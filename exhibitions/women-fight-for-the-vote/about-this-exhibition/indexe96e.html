Anthony, <em>The Revolution</em>, 1869 </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Notions of equality that inspired America&rsquo;s war for independence from Great Britain brought only modest and fleeting change to the status of women, most of whom remained &ldquo;civilly dead.&rdquo; Women had no legal identity separate from their husbands and were unable to sign contracts, own property, obtain access to education, obtain divorces easily, and gain custody of their children after divorce well into the nineteenth century. The desire to address this inequality and challenge the country to live up to its revolutionary promise led to a two-day convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, where 300 women and men gathered to debate Elizabeth Cady Stanton&rsquo;s Declaration of Sentiments. Modeled after the Declaration of Independence, it outlined women&rsquo;s inferior status and included a radical demand for suffrage. </p>\r\n<p>After Seneca Falls, women&rsquo;s rights conventions became annual events, where women met to discuss educational opportunities, divorce reform, property rights, and sometimes labor issues. Women lent their support to abolishing slavery believing universal suffrage would follow, but both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments ignored their demand for suffrage. National leaders responded differently, leading to a split in the movement and contrasting campaigns for voting rights at the local, state, and national levels. In 1878 the first federal women&rsquo;s suffrage amendment was introduced but was soundly defeated later in the first full Senate vote in 1887. As the nineteenth century neared an end, competing national suffrage groups reunited as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), and groundwork was laid for a national movement.</p>\r\n", "pagination": "1 of 5", "layout": "theme", "description": ["\r\n\tMen, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less."], "title": "Seneca Falls and Building a Movement, 1776&ndash;1890", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/", "imageurl": ["/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890.jpg"], "slug": "seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890", "content": "online-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890.html", "banner_image": "/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890-banner.jpg", "active": false, "link": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/", "children": [{"style": "gallery", "layout": "subtheme", "title": "Early Feminist Inspirations", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/early-feminist-inspirations/?st=gallery", "caption_description": "\u201cMrs. Wollstonecraft.\u201d Engraved by Ridley from a painting by Opie.

Considered the largest reform movement in United States history, its participants believed that securing the vote was essential to achieving women&rsquo;s economic, social, and political equality. Culminating 100 years ago in the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the fight for women&rsquo;s suffrage was not for the fainthearted. Determined women organized, lobbied, paraded, petitioned, lectured, and picketed for years. Suffragists were ridiculed, patronized, and dismissed by opponents, yet they persisted. Some were assaulted and endured the harsh confines of prison for daring to claim rights equal to men, but they would not be denied. </p>\r\nThe movement questioned the country&rsquo;s commitment to democracy, exposed the nation&rsquo;s longstanding class, regional, and racial divides, and challenged existing gender stereotypes.

Determined women organized, lobbied, paraded, petitioned, lectured, and picketed for years. Suffragists were ridiculed, patronized, and dismissed by opponents, yet they persisted. Some were assaulted and endured the harsh confines of prison for daring to claim rights equal to men, but they would not be denied. </p>\r\nThe movement questioned the country&rsquo;s commitment to democracy, exposed the nation&rsquo;s longstanding class, regional, and racial divides, and challenged existing gender stereotypes.

The desire to address this inequality and challenge the country to live up to its revolutionary promise led to a two-day convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848, where 300 women and men gathered to debate Elizabeth Cady Stanton&rsquo;s Declaration of Sentiments. Modeled after the Declaration of Independence, it outlined women&rsquo;s inferior status and included a radical demand for suffrage. </p>\r\n<p>After Seneca Falls, women&rsquo;s rights conventions became annual events, where women met to discuss educational opportunities, divorce reform, property rights, and sometimes labor issues. Women lent their support to abolishing slavery believing universal suffrage would follow, but both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments ignored their demand for suffrage. National leaders responded differently, leading to a split in the movement and contrasting campaigns for voting rights at the local, state, and national levels. In 1878 the first federal women&rsquo;s suffrage amendment was introduced but was soundly defeated later in the first full Senate vote in 1887. As the nineteenth century neared an end, competing national suffrage groups reunited as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), and groundwork was laid for a national movement.</p>\r\n", "pagination": "1 of 5", "layout": "theme", "description": ["\r\n\tMen, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less."], "title": "Seneca Falls and Building a Movement, 1776&ndash;1890", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/", "imageurl": ["/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890.jpg"], "slug": "seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890", "content": "online-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890.html", "banner_image": "/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890-banner.jpg", "active": false, "link": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/", "children": [{"style": "gallery", "layout": "subtheme", "title": "Early Feminist Inspirations", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/seneca-falls-and-building-a-movement-1776-1890/early-feminist-inspirations/?st=gallery", "caption_description": "\u201cMrs. Wollstonecraft.\u201d Engraved by Ridley from a painting by Opie.

After Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment and suffragists had secured the required three-fourths majority of the states, the amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920. Three months later, in a presidential election year, millions of women across the country could vote for the first time. </p>\r\n<p>The National American Woman Suffrage Association quickly transformed into the League of Women Voters with an emphasis on voter education, citizen participation, and legal, economic, and educational advancement of women, which continues to this day. Simultaneously, the National Woman&rsquo;s Party introduced the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) hoping to secure further rights for women; the ERA cleared the Senate in 1972 but remains unratified. A remarkably hard-fought accomplishment, the Nineteenth Amendment was just the beginning of successive achievements, as waves of women activists drew strength and inspiration from the suffragists who had preceded them and had furthered the nation&rsquo;s democratic ideal of equality for all.</p>\r\n\r\n", "pagination": "4 of 5", "layout": "theme", "title": "Hear Us Roar: Victory, 1918 and Beyond", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond/", "imageurl": ["/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond.jpg"], "slug": "hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond", "content": "online-exhibition/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond.html", "banner_image": "/static/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/images/featured-theme-items/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond-banner.jpg", "active": false, "link": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond/", "children": [{"style": "gallery", "layout": "subtheme", "title": "House and Senate Passage Leads An Exhausting Ratification Campaign", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/women-fight-for-the-vote/about-this-exhibition/hear-us-roar-victory-1918-and-beyond/house-and-senate-passage-leads-an-exhausting-ratification-campaign/?st=gallery", "caption_description": "<em>Rep.
