The images were scanned from the Prints and Photographs Division's collection of original glass plate negatives. In addition, this online offering includes copy negatives made from many of the photographic prints the Division holds. The images were acquired from various sources.</p>      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of original glass plate negatives. Through high resolution scans, researchers now have access to all of the original Civil War negatives in the Library of Congress collections. Some images lack corresponding prints in the collection and have not been seen widely before. Of special interest are the stereo negatives, including the full plate stereo negatives and both sides of the cut plates. The high resolution scans allow researchers to examine the negatives for details such as facial expressions, buttons on uniforms, and building signs. The scans are of such superb quality that they will be suitable for publication purposes, making it no longer necessary to handle the fragile original glass plates.</p>      <p>The online Civil War Photographs collection includes material from several sources, as outlined below.</p>      <h4>Anthony-Taylor-Rand-Ordway-Eaton Collection</h4>      <p>The largest proportion of the online Civil War Photographs are from the Anthony-Taylor-Rand-Ordway-Eaton Collection. It contains negatives taken during the war under the supervision of Mathew B. Brady and Alexander Gardner and passed through many owners.</p>      <p>During the war, Brady transferred many negatives to the photographic supply firm of E. &amp; H. T. Anthony &amp;        Company to pay for his debts. Anthony &amp; Co. published these images in its \"War Views\" series.</p>      <p>In 1879 the negatives were purchased by Colonel Arnold A. Rand and General Albert Ordway, veterans of the war, and collectors of war memorabilia. Their collection also included approximately 2,000 negatives by Alexander Gardner and his team of photographers. Gardner had originally managed Brady's Washington studio, but he left Brady's employment in November 1862 to set up his own business.</p>      <p>Rand and Ordway sold the entire collection to Civil War veteran John C. Taylor, who published lantern slides and stereo views during the 1880s and early 1890s under the imprints Taylor &amp; Huntington and the War Photograph &amp; Exhibition Company.</p>      <p>In 1907 Edward B. Eaton bought the negatives. He used them in several books he published on the Civil War. The most notable of these was the ten-volume work, The Photographic History of the Civil War.</p>      <p>In 1916 the collection was placed in storage, where it remained until the Library purchased it in 1943. The Library's acquisition included 7,500 original glass plate negatives and about 2,500 glass and film copy negatives, providing a total of about 3,750 different views and about 2,650 different portraits.</p>      <p>The Library of Congress selected 1,047 of these images for publication as a microfilm in 1961. The <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/articles-and-essays/1961-microfilm-edition-booklet/\">introduction to the microfilm</a> includes a <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/articles-and-essays/1961-microfilm-edition-booklet/table-of-contents\">table of contents</a> that indicates how this portion of the collection was organized into five major sections and numerous subsections. The catalog records for these 1,047 negatives contain more information and subject headings than the catalog records for the remainder of the negatives. (See <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/technical-information\">Describing the Collection</a> for further details; see the <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/rights-and-access\">Search Tip</a> for information about strategies for searching the records effectively.)</p>      <p>The Library grouped the negatives into series by size and broad subject area. Each negative series has a distinct numerical prefix. The general content of each of the negative series is outlined in the section, <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/rights-and-access\">The Civil War Negatives: Arrangement and Online Access</a>.</p>      <h4>Brady-Handy Collection - Three Negative Series</h4>      <p>Some negatives from the studio of Mathew B. Brady came into the hands of his nephew, Levin C. Handy, who operated a photographic studio in Washington, D.C. The Library of Congress purchased the L.C. Handy Studio negatives in 1954. Negatives from this source are distinguished by the prefix LC-BH8. Three Brady Handy negative series have been incorporated into the Civil War Photographs because of their close connection to the other items in this pool of records and images. The content of the three negative series is outlined in the section, <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/rights-and-access\">The Civil War Negatives: Arrangement and Online Access.</a> (The remainder of the Brady Handy negatives, which deal primarily with post-Civil War subjects, are available separately as the <a href=\"/collections/brady-handy/about-this-collection/\">Brady Handy Collection</a>.)</p>      <h4>Civil War Photograph LOTs - Some Copy Negatives</h4>      <p>The Civil War Photograph LOTs consist of photographic prints arranged by subject matter into LOTs (groups). The Library acquired the prints from three main sources:</p>      <ul>        <li>In 1905 the Library purchased gelatin silver prints from John C. Taylor.</li>        <li>In 1948 the Library purchased a large group of mounted albumen prints from General Ordway\u2019s son.</li>        <li>In the 1950s and 1960s, the Library's Photoduplication Service made prints from the glass plate negatives.</li>      </ul>      <p>As requests for reproductions have been made over time, copy negatives have been made from some of these prints.</p>      <h4>Civil War Stereograph Collection - Some Copy Negatives</h4>      <p>The Civil War Stereograph Collection consists of stereographs published by a variety of firms including E. &amp; H. T. Anthony &amp; Co. and The War Photograph &amp;        Exhibition Company acquired through various means. The Library has made copy negatives from some of these stereographs to respond to requests for reproductions.</p>      <h4>Glass negatives of Union soldiers at Folly and Morris Islands during the siege of Charleston, South Carolina, photographed by Haas &amp; Peale.</h4>      <p>Philip Haas of Company A, 1st New York Engineers, and Washington Peale photographed General Quincy A. Gillmore's efforts to capture Charleston, South Carolina, in 1863. This small batch of negatives show Union troops patrolling the islands off the Carolina coast. The Library acquired Haas and Peale's original glass plate negatives in 1966.</p>      <h4>Images of Enlisted Men</h4>      <p>In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Library copied approximately 50 images of enlisted men from daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes in private collections. (The resulting negatives are in the B8184 series.) The original photographs were returned to their owners, but the Library did not retain a record of the collector's names and addresses. Any information on the provenance of these original photographs would be welcomed. Please write to the Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540-4730 or contact us through our <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/askalib/ask-print2.html\">Ask-a-Librarian</a> form.

These include:</p>      <ul>        <li>Photographic prints in the Civil War Photograph LOTs that either do not have a corresponding original negative or do not have a corresponding copy negative that has been made available online. The division plans to add these to the online collection.</li>        <li>Original prints by George Barnard and Andrew J. Russell (see <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/related-resources\">Related Resources</a> for a list of these and other groups of Civil War photographs).</li>        <li>Ambrotypes, tintypes, and other photographs from the Civil War era. For more information, see <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/related-resources\">Related Resources</a>.</li>        <li>The Division has a few original portrait photographs of Abraham Lincoln, but most of its Lincoln portraits are copy prints.

Also included are reconnaissance maps, sketch maps,   coastal charts, and theater of war maps. An  <a href=\"/collections/civil-war-maps/articles-and-essays/history-of-mapping-the-civil-war/\">introductory   essay</a> traces the development of mapping during the Civil War, with special   reference to maps and atlases in the Geography and Map Division. The Geography and Map   Division materials are based on Civil War Maps: An Annotated List of Maps and Atlases   in the Library of Congress, compile by Richard W. Stephenson in 1989. This bibliography   not only includes descriptions of printed, photoreproduced, annotated, and hand-drawn   maps made between 1861 and 1865, but also maps made later to illustrate or explain   specific events, movements, and battles of the war. The vast majority of the maps were   prepared by Federal forces or by commercial firms in the North, but there are also a   substantial number by Confederate military authorities and a few by Southern   publishers.</p>    <p>The largest group among the Confederate works are the 341 manuscript maps and sketch   books that make up the Hotchkiss Map Collection. Assembled by Major Jedediah Hotchkiss,   who served as topographic engineer with the Army of Northern Virginia, this remarkable   collection was acquired by the Library of Congress in 1948 from Hotchkiss's   granddaughter, Mrs. R. E. Christian of Deerfield, Virginia. The entries for the   collection, described in a separate section, were prepared in 1951 by Clara Egli LeGear   and were originally published by the Library of Congress under the title The Hotchkiss   Map Collection: A List of Manuscript Maps, Many of the Civil War Period, Prepared by   Major Jedediah Hotchkiss, and Other Manuscript and Annotated Maps in His   Possession.</p>    <p>Included here are maps of the whole United States, maps of major regions such as the   Eastern or Southern States, maps showing all or parts of more than two states, and maps   of the Mississippi River. State maps are also included, with maps of specific battles,   cities and towns, and natural features listed alphabetically under each state.</p>    <p>In addition to the Hotchkiss Map Collection, the Sherman Map Collection is also   presented. Consisting of 210 maps and 3 atlases belonging to Gen. William Tecumseh   Sherman, it was formed by the Library of Congress from three separate accessions. The   first, received in 1912, numbered some 58 maps that were included among the papers   presented to the Library of Congress by Sherman's son, Philemon Tecumseh Sherman. A   second segment was obtained in 1942 from the general's granddaughter, Miss Eleanor   Sherman Fitch. The final group of maps was obtained in 1955 from the William L.   Clements Library, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in exchange for a copy of Joseph F. W. Des   Barres's The Atlantic Neptune (London, 1774-1781). The collection includes a   significant number of maps and atlases owned by Sherman either before or after the   war.</p>    <p>The Library of Virginia's map collection includes about 200 maps relating to   the Civil War. Of the maps included in this project, there are maps accompanying a   report to the Governor of Virginia, Confederate imprints, a variety of printed and   manuscript maps, mostly of Virginia areas, and a small group of field maps of   Southwestern Virginia found in books belonging to Major General William W. Loring,   C.S.A.</p>    <p>The Virginia Historical Society items include images created by officers of the   Confederate Army's Engineer Corps of counties and regions within Virginia   (including the so-called  Jeremy Gilmer  maps). These manuscript maps are   distinctive in that they include not only roads, bridges, waterways, and major   buildings, but also identify farms and plantations by owners' surnames. Another   set of images comes from the multi-volume diary and scrapbook of Union Private Robert   K. Sneden, who served with the Army of the Potomac. These consist primarily of battle   plans and details of fortifications both in Virginia and elsewhere. Some of   Sneden's work has been reproduced in two recent publications, Eye of the Storm   and Images from the Storm. The few remaining images in the collection are drawn more   generally from the Society's manuscript holdings, including those contained in   the letters of individual soldiers.</p>    <p>Most of the entries include a brief paragraph describing the contents of the map,   but no attempt has been made to analyze the maps completely or to evaluate them   critically.</p>    <p>All three libraries actively seek to enrich their cartographic collection and would   welcome information that may lead to the acquisitions of maps and atlases of the   American Civil War not already included in their holdings. Any new, original items   received by the Library of Congress will be included in updates to this online   collection. New selections from the Stephenson bibliography will be added monthly.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "date": "1999", "shelf_id": "~/collections/civil-war-maps/about-this-collection/", "other_title": ["Civil War maps collection"], "count": 2338, "dates": ["1861-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1862-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1863-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1864-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1865-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1999-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2006577703"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-war-maps/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-war-maps/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/civil-war-maps/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/civil-war-maps/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-war-maps/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/cwm/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2006577703", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2006577703/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/collgmd.gm000006", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgmd.gm000006/"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "site": ["lcweb"], "original_format": ["web page"], "id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmss5/civil_war2.html", "index": 7, "group": ["memory"], "title": "Civil War:Manuscript Division", "online_format": ["web page"], "partof": ["american memory"], "mime_type": ["text/html"], "digitized": true, "description": ["Manuscript Division,Civil War"], "timestamp": "2020-01-12T02:09:16.142Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-11T21:35:54.855Z", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmss5/civil_war2.html", "other_title": [], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmss5/civil_war2.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": [], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmss5/civil_war2.html"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "original_format": ["map"], "id": "http://lccn.loc.gov/2006577703", "partof": ["catalog"], "subject": ["atlantic coast (u.s.)", "civil war", "united states", "maps", "19th century", "history"], "index": 8, "group": ["catalog"], "title": "Civil War maps", "location": ["united states", "atlantic coast"], "digitized": true, "description": ["Civil War Maps brings together materials from three premier collections: the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division, the Virginia Historical Society, and the Library of Virginia.
