Dexter&#8217;s new pastor, <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3c26559/\">Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, was appointed the group&#8217;s leader. For the next year, the Montgomery Improvement Association coordinated the bus boycott and King, an eloquent young preacher, inspired those who refused to ride:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>If we are wrong\u2014the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong\u2014God almighty is wrong! If we are wrong\u2014Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer and never came down to earth. If we are wrong\u2014justice is a lie. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.&#8221; <sup><a id=\"text1\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\"><cite>Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Montgomery, Alabama, 1955.</cite></p></blockquote>\r\n<p id=\"fn2ret\">During the boycott, King insisted that protestors retain the moral high ground, hinting at his later strategy of nonviolent resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>This is not a war between the white and the Negro but a conflict between justice and injustice. If we are arrested every day, if we are exploited every day, if we are trampled over every day, don&#8217;t ever let anyone pull you so low as to hate them. We must use the weapon of love. <sup><a id=\"text2\" href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n<p class=\"cite\"><cite>Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Montgomery, Alabama, 1955.</cite></p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 1956 the Supreme Court banned segregation on public transportation and the boycott ended over a year after it had begun. Rosa and Raymond Parks moved to Detroit where, for more than twenty years, the &#8220;Mother of the Civil Rights Movement&#8221; worked for Congressman <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000714\">John Conyers</a>. In addition to the Rosa Parks Peace Prize (Stockholm, 1994) and the U.S. Medal of Freedom (1996), Rosa Parks has been awarded two-dozen honorary doctorates from universities around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosa Parks died on October 24, 2005, at the age of ninety-two, at her home in Detroit, Michigan. On October 30, 2005, Parks became the first woman to lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.</p>\r\n<ol class=\"footnote\">\r\n\t<li id=\"fn1\">Martin Luther King Jr. <em>The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr</em>. ed.

He rose to international fame in 1910 for his work with the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/ballets-russes/\">Ballets Russes</a>, an innovative company founded in Paris by fellow Russian Sergei Diaghilev that launched the careers of major artists including dancers, choreographers, composers, and designers. In 1928, Stravinsky worked with Balanchine, then a choreographer for the Ballets Russes, to produce <em>Apollo</em> (using Stravinsky\u2019s <em>Apollon musag\u00e8te)</em>, the first work in their extraordinary and enduring creative partnership.</p>\r\n<p>Balanchine\u2019s and Kirstein\u2019s founding of the New York City Ballet in 1948 gave Balanchine the platform he needed to create a series of masterpieces in which his choreography collaborated with Stravinsky\u2019s music. <em>Agon</em> was among these. Some of the dances in <em>Agon</em>, an abstract, plotless ballet for eight female and four male dancers, were suggested by a description of seventeenth-century French court dances. <em>Recueil de dances, compos\u00e9es par M. Feuillet</em>, a compilation of works choreographed by Raoul-Auger Feuillet and bound with his <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/resource/musdi.072.0/\"><em>Chor\u00e9graphie, ou l&#8217;art de d\u00e9crire la dance par caract\u00e8res. . . </em></a> is a work from that very era.
