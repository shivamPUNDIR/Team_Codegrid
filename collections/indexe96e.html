These items date from 1899 to 1981, with most from the 1920s through the 1950s, and were selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and\u00a0photographs.</p> <p>Celebrating the centennial of the birth of the American composer Aaron Copland (1900-1990), the multi-format Aaron Copland Collection, from which the online collection derives, spans the years 1910 to 1990 and includes approximately 400,000 items documenting the multifaceted life of an extraordinary person who was composer, performer, teacher, writer, conductor, commentator, and administrator. It comprises both manuscript and printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries, writings, scrapbooks, programs, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, awards, books, sound recordings, and motion pictures.</p>  <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Aaron Copland devoted his life as a twentieth-century composer to fostering, developing, creating, and establishing distinctive \"American\" music. He became known as the \"Dean of American Music,\" a sobriquet with which he was uncomfortable. His name is synonymous with\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0\u2014the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize in Music\u2014and\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/f/#work0021\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>.</p> <p>Copland extensively documented the many facets of his life in music, and the<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress reflects the entire breadth of his endeavors. Beginning in the late 1950s and early &lsquo;60s, Copland periodically deposited his original music manuscripts at the Library of Congress and subsequently converted them to gifts. In the fall of 1989, he donated all his papers to the Library. The collection numbers approximately four hundred thousand items, dating from 1910 to 1990 with a few nineteenth-century photographs, and includes his music manuscripts, printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries and writings, photographic materials, awards, honorary degrees, programs, and other biographical materials. It is the primary resource for research on Aaron Copland and a major resource for the study of musical life in twentieth-century America generally, particularly from the 1920s to the 1960s.</p> <p>The online\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0comprises approximately one thousand items selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and photographs. The items are represented in about five thousand digitized images, the earliest an 1899 photograph and the latest a 1986 letter. While the original collection contains almost all Copland's music manuscripts and printed scores, the online collection presents the original music sketches that Copland used in composing thirty-one works spanning the years 1924 to 1967 and covering every medium in which he composed: orchestral, ballet, opera, film, chamber, solo piano, and vocal music.</p> <p>The correspondence in the online collection comprises images of approximately eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Copland that have been selected from the Aaron Copland Collection and other collections in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0at the Library of Congress. Besides letters to his parents and other family members in the 1920s and 30s, the correspondence includes Copland's letters to his Parisian teacher Nadia Boulanger, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and others such as Nicolas Slonimsky, Roger Sessions, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Walter Piston, Leonard Bernstein, and Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>As an advocate and supporter of American music and American composers, Copland frequently wrote articles, presented lectures, and delivered speeches. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0presents eighty-six of Copland's previously unpublished drafts. These show the creative process through which he wrote about his own music, other composers and their music, and other people who played important roles in his musical life.</p> <p>Of the twelve thousand photographic materials in the Library's Aaron Copland Collection, 111 items have been chosen for online presentation. Many were created by Copland's friend Victor Kraft, a professional photographer. They include portraits of Aaron Copland at various ages and places, with family members, with other composers, and with other people associated with his career as a composer and conductor, as well as images from his worldwide travels.</p>  <h2>The Copland Letters</h2>  <p>\"The man is in the letters,\" said Vivian Perlis of Aaron Copland, whose autobiography she helped to write. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0contains digitized images of over eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland covering the years from 1921 to 1986. Searchable texts of all published letters, postcards, and telegrams in the collection are also available.</p> <p>The letters reproduced in the collection represent, though they do not exhaust, the holdings of Copland's correspondence in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0of the Library of Congress. In general they constitute significant runs of letters to people important in Copland's life. (Problems of copyright and volume preclude making letters to Copland available online.) Every attempt has been made to include all the letters in the Music Division that Copland wrote to each correspondent represented, the one exception being the letters to Harold Spivacke, which constitute only a part of Copland's voluminous and largely business-related correspondence with the Music Division's former chief.</p> <p>These letters come from many collections in the Music Division. Besides material from the Aaron Copland Collection, they contain material from the Leonard Bernstein Collection, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Collection, the Jacobo Ficher Collection, the Irving Fine Collection, the Louis Kaufman Collection, the Serge Koussevitzky Collection, the\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives, the Walter Piston Collection, the Nicolas Slonimsky Collection, the William Strickland Collection, and the papers of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music.</p> <p>The letters Copland wrote that are in the Copland Collection proper came back to him in various ways. He inherited his letters to his parents after their deaths. In the 1970s, when he began to think of writing his autobiography, he asked several of his friends and colleagues to send him photocopies of his letters. Some replied with photocopies, some by returning the letters themselves. Some responded with many letters, some with just a few.</p> <p>Copland seldom made carbons copies of his outgoing correspondence. The few periods in his life for which the Copland Collection is rich in carbon copies are the brief intervals when he had a secretary: in 1943 while working on the film\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>; during his South American tour in 1947; in the fall of 1958 when he was staying in London and presumably was provided with a secretary by his publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Because they were obviously dictated to a secretary, these letters have the flavor of Copland's post-1940 correspondence but are not particularly trenchant, lacking the distinctive qualities that came forth when Copland himself sat down to write.</p>  <p>The following individuals are the major correspondents represented in the letters portion of this online collection. They are listed with the source collection for Copland's letters to them or, in the case of material in the Copland Collection itself, with an indication of whether the letters are originals or photocopies.</p> <p><strong>Arthur Berger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopy). The online collection contains a <a href=\"/resource/copland.corr0796?sp=1\">single letter</a>\u00a0to this writer of the first book-length study of Copland; it is perhaps the most evocative of Copland's letters describing his Mexican visits.</p> <p><strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong>\u00a0(Bernstein Collection). Copland's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the late 1930s and early 1940s,\u00a0Bernstein\u00a0became one of the leading champions and interpreters of Copland's music.</p> <p><strong>Nadia Boulanger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Copland's principal teacher and mentor. His Nonet is dedicated to her.</p> <p><strong>Paul Bowles</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Composer and novelist. The two letters in the Copland Collection seem to have been part of a voluminous and regular correspondence.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). English composer. The first set of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0was written for Britten and his collaborator Peter Pears. Britten's side of the correspondence is published in Donald Mitchell et al., eds.,\u00a0<em>Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, 1913-1976\u00a0</em>(2 vols., Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).</p> <p><strong>Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). Mexican composer; one of Copland's principal composer friends. As a conductor, Ch\u00e1vez performed Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/s/#work0012\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0when American conductors had declared it unperformable. Ch\u00e1vez's side of the correspondence and slightly abridged versions of Copland's letters are published in Spanish translation in Gloria Carmona, ed.,\u00a0<em>Epistolario selecto de Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</em>\u00a0(M\u00e9xico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, 1989).</p> <p><strong>Israel Citkowitz\u00a0</strong>(Copland Collection; originals). Citkowitz was a slightly younger composer (1909-1974), gifted in song and chamber music, for whom Copland had high hopes. The online collection contains all Copland's letters to Citkowitz in the Copland Collection.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection). American patron of chamber music. She commissioned from Copland (and thus had dedicated to her) <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/q/#work0067\">Piano Quartet</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jacobo Ficher</strong>\u00a0(Ficher Collection). Argentinian composer. Copland's letters to him document his interest in South American music.</p> <p><strong>Irving and Verna Fine</strong>\u00a0(Irving Fine Collection). Irving Fine was a composer and younger colleague of Copland whose choral arrangements of several of Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0have given them a life as choral works. Copland shared houses with Irving and Verna Fine for several summers at Tanglewood. After Irving Fine's death in 1962 Copland continued to be supportive of Verna Fine, and his letters to her retain warmth and sparkle to the end of his letter-writing years. Copland dedicated \"Sleep Is Supposed to Be,\" one of the two central songs of his<em> </em><a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0074\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>, to Irving Fine. The Irving Fine Collection also contains letters from Copland to Verna Fine's mother, Florence Rudnick, in whose Boston apartment he sequestered himself to write\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/i/#work0065\"><em>In the Beginning</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky</strong>\u00a0(Koussevitzky Collection). Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony from 1924 to 1949, was the first performer to champion Copland's music in America and remained a supporter of Copland (and of many other American composers) until his death. Copland, in turn, was a major help to Koussevitzky from 1940 on in the running of the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood. Copland's letters to Koussevitzky's first wife, Natalie, are, for the most part, social; his letters to Koussevitzky's second wife, Olga (Olga Naumoff, Koussevitzky's secretary, until 1947), concern the running of Tanglewood. Copland's\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0025\">Third Symphony</a>\u00a0is dedicated \"To the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.\"</p> <p><strong>Minna Lederman</strong>\u00a0(<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives). Lederman was editor of the journal of the League of Composers,\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>, which was published from 1924 to 1946. Copland was a major contributor to the magazine and a trusted advisor to Lederman.</p> <p><strong>Marcelle de Manziarly</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). French composer, Boulanger student. Copland dedicated \"Heart, We Will Forget Him,\" the fifth of his<em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, to de Manziarly.</p>  <p><strong>Olga Naumoff:</strong>\u00a0see Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky.</p> <p><strong>Walter Piston</strong>\u00a0(Piston Collection). American composer. The body of Piston's correspondence is in the Boston Public Library; the one letter in this online collection represents the small but important collection of letters to Piston from the years 1931-55 that is in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.</p> <p><strong>Florence Rudnick:</strong>\u00a0see Irving and Verna Fine.</p> <p><strong>Roger Sessions</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies) American composer; co-producer with Copland of the Copland-Sessions Concerts during the years 1928-31.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Slonimsky</strong>\u00a0(Slonimsky Collection; some early letters in the Koussevitzky Collection). Musical polymath. During most of the period in which Copland corresponded with him he was musical secretary to Koussevitzky; the jokey letters to the incorrigibly humorous Slonimsky serve to balance Copland's oh-so-serious letters to Koussevitzky himself.</p> <p><strong>Harold Spivacke</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection; Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music). Chief of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, 1937-1972. Spivacke's tact and unflappable serenity kept the commissioning of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0on course.</p> <p><strong>William Strickland</strong>\u00a0(Strickland Collection). American conductor. Some of the letters in this online collection are concerned with Strickland's editorship of the H. W. Gray organ series, for which Copland wrote his\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/e/#work0097\"><em>Episode</em></a>.</p> <p>\"The man is in the letters.\" It might then seem as though a collection of more than eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland would give a complete portrait of the man and the composer. However, users of this online collection should remember that these letters represent only the holdings of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. At least equally important are Copland's letters to Virgil Thomson (at Yale University); Claire Reis and William Schuman (at the New York Public Library); Howard Clurman, David Diamond, and Walter Piston (at the Boston Public Library); and several others. To each of his correspondents Copland shows a slightly different aspect of his personality, so the letters in this online collection provide a detailed self-portrait if not a complete one.</p>  <h2>The Copland Sketches</h2>  <p>This online collection contains approximately 2500 pages of Aaron Copland's sketches\u00a0for his music, representing thirty-one of his works\u2014thirty-three if one includes the\u00a0<em>Sextet</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>Orchestra Variations</em>, covered by the sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>\u00a0respectively. Representing many of Copland's best-known and most significant works, the sketches are often revelatory. Except for some miscellaneous accompanying material, the online collection includes all the sketches for the works in the online collection.</p> <p>There are works for which the Library of Congress's archival Copland Collection contains no sketches. These include some of the early works and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>. Those who are interested in finding out whether the Library has sketches for a particular work not represented in the online collection, or curious about whether one of the works included has any material not presented online, should consult the Copland Collection Finding Aid.</p> <p>Within the sections of the online collection, the sketches are presented as much as possible in the order in which they were received from Aaron Copland or his estate. They have been much used by scholars, and they represent Copland's not always systematic use of music-paper. Some sets of sketches have been numbered by stamp at their top left- or right-hand corner; this numeration was done by the Library of Congress when the sketches were filmed in the mid-1970s and do not represent Copland's numbering. When two separate sets of sketches exist for a single work, they are presented here as two separate items. (Note: The page numbers of some of these sketches may not appear in numerical order online. However, they are presented here in exactly the order that Copland produced them.)</p> <p>The sketches reveal to scholars the history of Copland's work on the compositions, but they can also mean something to the general reader. The sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0022?sp=1\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>\u00a0show Copland searching for titles to do justice to three of his most characteristic works; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0032?sp=1\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>\u00a0show him deciding what poems to include in the cycle; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0015?sp=1\"><em>Billy the Kid</em></a> show that the opening music was first intended to be the start of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0014?sp=1\"><em>Music for Radio</em></a>\u2014 which now begins with much more complex music.</p>  <h2>The Copland Photographs</h2>  <p>The photographic materials in the Library of Congress's\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>number more than twelve thousand items spanning the years 1889 to 1985 and include both black and white and color prints, contact sheets, 35-mm negatives, color slides, and photograph albums. A substantial number of photographs were taken by Copland's lifelong friend, the professional photographer Victor Kraft. Widely known photographers whose work can be found in the collection include Carl Van Vechten, Irving Penn, Gordon Parks, and Margaret Bourke-White. The subject material comprises an inclusive chronology of Copland's life and includes Copland's family; Copland himself throughout his life; friends; acquaintances; fellow composers and other people with whom he worked; places where he studied, composed, or visited; and special events.</p> <p>From this vast collection, 111 photographs have been initially selected for the online collection. The digitized images fall into five broad categories: Family ; Copland Alone; Copland's Music; Copland with Other Composers and People; and Places and Events. Photographs that cannot be dated precisely or approximately have been given the designation of \"middle\" or \"late.\"</p> <h2>Family</h2> <p>Of the seven family photographs, one is a formal sitting of Copland's paternal grandparents and three of their children, while another shows Copland's parents, Sarah and Harris Copland, in front of their department store in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922. The other five capture Copland with other family members.</p> <h2>Aaron Copland Alone</h2> <p>The twenty-four photographs of Copland alone show him both formally and informally and at a range of ages from six to his seventies. Several feature Copland at his home, Rock Hill, in Courtlandt near Peekskill, New York.</p>  <h2>Copland's Music</h2> <p>Twenty-one photographs capture performances or rehearsals of thirteen musical works. The orchestral works represented are the\u00a0<em>Piano Concerto</em>, in a photograph showing Copland at the piano and Andr\u00e9 Previn conducting; the\u00a0<em>Clarinet Concerto</em>with Benny Goodman as the soloist and Copland conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>\u00a0in two rehearsal photographs, one in color with Marian Anderson as the speaker and the other with Adlai Stevenson, both with Copland conducting. The two ballets represented are scenes from the premiere performance of\u00a0<em>Appalachian Spring</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress and\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em>, which was premiered by Lincoln Kirstein and the Ballet Caravan.</p> <p>Three of the eight films for which Copland wrote music scores are illustrated in this online collection. Production stills represent\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>. There are also two informal photographs of the making of\u00a0<em>The Red Pon</em>y depicting Copland with the pony and the young boy and one studio-recording shot of Copland conducting the music for\u00a0<em>Something Wild</em>\u00a0that shows the star, Carroll Baker, in a television monitor.</p> <p>One chamber work is represented in a rehearsal of the\u00a0<em>Nonet</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress with Copland conducting. Two photographs depict William Warfield with Copland during rehearsals of\u00a0<em>Old American Songs</em>. There is also a stage shot of the opera\u00a0<em>The Tender Land</em>.</p>  <h2>Copland with Other Composers and People</h2> <p>Numerous photographs capture Copland with fellow composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Norman Dello Joio, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Irving Fine, Arthur Berger, Douglas Moore, Benjamin Britten, Darius Milhaud, Philip Ramey, Walter Piston, Domingo Santa Cruz, Virgil Thomson, Roger Sessions, and Igor Stravinsky. He is also shown with such notable cultural figures and musicians as Artur Rubinstein, Claire Booth Luce, Clarence Adler, Nadia Boulanger, Victor Kraft, Vivian Perlis, Claire Reis, Jack Garfein, Thorton Wilder, Serge Koussevitzky, Agnes de Mille, and Oliver Smith.</p> <h2>Places and Events</h2> <p>The group of photographs entitled Places and Events shows Coplan Fontainebleau and Aldeburgh; in Paris, Germany, England, Peru, Israel, and Mexico; at Nadia Boulanger's studio with other students; at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and Tanglewood; and at the University of Kansas, Brown University and Columbia University.</p> <h2>The Copland Writings</h2>  <p>Aaron Copland was best known first as a composer and later, in the 1960s and '70s, as a conductor. His name is less frequently associated with literary endeavors. The\u00a0Writings\u00a0portion of the\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0suggests that in this respect his reputation should perhaps be revised: it includes a vast array of articles, lectures, speeches, book drafts, and radio and television commentaries that span the years 1925 to 1988. The long stream of Copland's literary efforts began with an article written for publication in 1925, shortly after his return to the United States from three years in Paris, and continued into the late 1970s and early 1980s. He displayed the same technique in his writings that he did in his music: that is, a frequent self-borrowing in which he used the same material in different media.</p> <p>The writings selected for this online collection comprise eighty-six items. The selections represent unpublished drafts of material for articles, lectures, and speeches. Some selections display Copland's literary processes in thoughtful revisions, word changes, rearranging, and other editorial techniques. He usually began with handwritten notes or drafts and proceeded through several typewritten drafts before creating a final unmarked typewritten version. (Example: \"A Visit to Snape,\"\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0026?sp=1\">Version 2</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0027?sp=1\">Version 3</a>\u00a0) Not every literary work in the Aaron Copland Collection illustrates this transformation, however. The lectures and speeches display another aspect of Copland's literary endeavors: the fact that he underscored almost every word in red or blue pencil. Because he probably made these markings to help him deliver his speeches, they recapture something of the sound as well as the thought of his vocal presentations. They also add a colorful element to the handwritten and typed drafts.</p> <p>Like many conductors, Copland used a similar device in his conducting scores, where red and blue pencil markings draw the eye to changes in time signature, dynamics, and the entrances of instruments. [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0092?sp=1\">\"Talk on Leonard Bernstein\"</a>]</p> <p>Whatever their intended uses, the online examples of Copland's unpublished writings can be grouped into four categories: autobiographical, about Copland's music, about other composers, and about other people.</p> <p>The two autobiographical titles contrast the esoteric concerns of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0005?sp=1\">\"Music and the Human Spirit\"</a>, in which Copland addresses \"the creation of an art music\" as one of \"humanity's truly unique achievements,\" with the practicality of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0003?sp=1\">\"The Composer as Conductor\"</a>\u00a0in which he recalls that \"Some twenty years ago, during the course of a memorable evening at the Stravinskys' home in Los Angeles, the venerable maestro turned to me and said in no uncertain terms: 'My dear, you should conduct your own music. All composers should conduct their own music!'\"</p> <p>The writings about Copland's music highlight eleven of Copland's compositions in five different media. Writings on two ballets describe his collaboration with Martha Graham (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0007?sp=1\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>) and his work with Lincoln Kirstein on the story for<em>Billy the Kid</em>, (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0008?sp=1\">\"About\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em></a>\" and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0018?sp=1\">\"Notes on a Cowboy Ballet\"</a>). Copland discusses the creation of his three major solo piano works,\u00a0<em>Piano Fantasy</em>\", \"<em>Piano Sonata</em>,\" and \"<em>Piano Variations</em>,\" in two different lectures under the title <a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0011?sp=1\">Compositional Phases [on My Three Piano Works]</a>.\" An article about the 1925 orchestral work\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0017?sp=1\"><em>Music for the Theatre</em></a>\u00a0summarizes the reaction of audiences, musicians, and reviewers in the United States and Europe, including the performance by the New York Symphony Orchestra in which its conductor, Dr. Walter Damrosch, had \"revenge in the end.\" Copland wrote\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0028?sp=1\">A Visit to Snape</a>\u00a0for a tribute to Benjamin Britten on his fiftieth birthday; in it, he extols the \"kind of composer rapport\" between them and the \"exchange of musical impressions\" between his own \"The Second Hurricane\" and Britten's Piano Concerto No. 1.</p> <p>As the composer of several film scores, Copland was frequently asked to lecture or write about composing for the movies. In his discussions on the subject, Copland speaks not only about his experiences and the scores he wrote, but about other film composers and working in Hollywood. In\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0012?sp=1\">\"Film Music\"</a>, a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art Film Library in 1940, Copland briefly describes Hollywood and the mysterious nature of film music. He talks about the music he wrote for the film\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0049\"><em>Of Mice and Men</em></a>; four film composers, Eric Korngold, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, and Herbert Stoddard; and some of their film scores. By the time he gave the lecture\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0015?sp=1\">\"Film Talk\"</a>\u00a0at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, Copland's credentials as a film composer included six feature films and two documentaries. On that occasion, excerpts from three features (<em>Something Wild</em>,\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>, and\u00a0<em>The Heiress</em>) and one documentary (<em>The City</em>) were screened as he commented on how music may help a film and how one sets music to a film.</p> <p>The largest category of writings in this online collection centers on Copland's views about other composers. In these works, Copland speaks not only about his American contemporaries but about Mozart\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0037?sp=1\">(\"At the Thought of Mozart\")</a>, Berlioz\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0039?sp=1\">(\"Berlioz - from the Composer's Standpoint\")</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0040?sp=1\">Pierre Boulez</a>;<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0049?sp=1\">Composers in Russia</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0051?sp=1\">Composers of South America</a>; Michael Tippett (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0055?sp=1\">\"Cousin Michael\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0057?sp=1\">Darius Milhaud</a>, Dmitri Shostakovitch (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0059?sp=1\">\"Dmitri Shostakovitch and the New Simplicity\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0060?sp=1\">Gabriel Faur\u00e9</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0062?sp=1\">Franz Liszt</a>, Gustav Mahler\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0077?sp=1\">(\"Mahler (XX Cent[ury]\")</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0091?sp=1\">Igor Stravinsky</a>, Serge Prokofieff [Sergey Prokofiev]\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0087?sp=1\">(\"On the Occasion of the 70th Birthday of Serge Prokofieff\")\u00a0</a>, Benjamin Britten\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0090?sp=1\">(\"Special Fondness for B.B. [Benjamin Britten]\")\u00a0</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0097?sp=1\">Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly</a>. Copland was concerned above all with educating others about composers and their music, and in these writings he sometimes presents his personal viewpoints and reflections. At the National Arts Club in 1968, for example, he spoke about Leonard Bernstein's gifts and how it was \"impossible to imagine the American musical scene in the last quarter century without him.\" [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0075?sp=1\">\"LB\"</a>]</p> <p>As Copland lived on through the century, he was asked to write celebratory epistles or obituaries about many of his contemporaries, whether they were composers or others who had influenced his life. These writings about other people offer Copland's portraits of his Parisian teacher, Nadia Boulanger\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0099?sp=1\">(\"Intro[duction] of N[adia] Boulanger as Teacher\")</a>; his early theory teacher, Rubin Goldmark<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0112?sp=1\">(\"Rubin Goldmark: A Tribute\")</a>; his publisher, Ralph Hawkes\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0111?sp=1\">(\"Ralph Hawkes: In Memoriam\")\u00a0</a>; his friend and colleague at the League of Composers,<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0109?sp=1\">Claire Reis</a>; and his long-time supporter, the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0114?sp=1\">(\"Serge Koussevitzky - The 100th Anniversary [unpublished writings]\")</a>. \"It is almost forty years since first I rang the bell at Nadia Boulanger's Paris apartment . . . \" begins the 1960 tribute to his teacher,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0102?sp=1\">(\"The Teacher: Nadia Boulanger\")</a>, the person who was most influential in molding and forming the composer Aaron Copland.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:06:10.084Z", "date": "1841", "shelf_id": "~/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "other_title": ["Copland collection,"], "count": 982, "dates": ["1841-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2003561015"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/copland/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2003561015", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2003561015/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/collmus.mu000006", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006.3/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006.3", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmus.mu000006/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.ahii"], "call_number": ["Guide Record"], "contributors": ["Abd\u00fclhamid II, Sultan of the Turks, 1842-1918 donor.", "Abdullah fr\u00e8res, photographer.", "Sebah & Joaillier, photographer."], "language": ["ota"], "title": "Abdul-Hamid II collection of photographs of the Ottoman Empire", "notes": ["Albums generally arranged by subject.

When the young boy fainted, he was taken to the guard house where two other boys his age observed all the excitement and reported back to their father, the Sultan, what they had seen.\u00a0Their father dispatched his emissaries to Hewitt's hotel to inquire about his son's well-being and to request that he and his son visit the palace the next day.</p>  <p>During the visit, the Sultan noticed Hewitt's indelible pencil and special cigarettes which resulted in a gift shipment to Abdul-Hamid II when Hewitt returned home. Shortly thereafter, Hewitt received a notice that he owed $1,480 in customs duties on a shipment of Ottoman books. He wrote back to the Sultan that he didn't deserve such an honor and that the Sultan should give the books to the Library of Congress. The Sultan agreed and had the special collection prepared for the Library and invited Hewitt to keep the first set for himself. Hewitt paid the duty and this set is now in the New York University Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.</p>  <p>By 1984, it was determined that the Abdul-Hamid II gift books had become very brittle with paper that was too fragile to serve to researchers and a decision was made to microfilm the collection. 309 books and serials have been scanned from this microfilm for this digital collection. There are 26 existent Abdul-Hamid II books which also have been digitized.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "shelf_id": "~/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 323, "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/hamidbooks/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000005", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009304", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009304.3", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/scd0001.20101124004al.1", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/scd0001.20101124004al.2"], "medium": ["40,550 items.", "221 containers plus 11 oversize.", "98 microfilm reels.", "48 linear feet."], "repository": ["Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home"], "contributors": ["Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865."], "title": "Abraham Lincoln papers,", "notes": ["Arranged in five series.

The Lincoln Papers came to the Library of  Congress from Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln (1843-1926), who  arranged for their organization and care shortly after his father was  assassinated on April 14, 1865. At that time, Robert Todd Lincoln had the  Lincoln Papers removed to Illinois, where they were first organized under the  direction of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln's  longtime associate. Later, Lincoln&rsquo;s presidential secretaries, John G. Nicolay  and John Hay, assisted in the project. In 1874, most of the Lincoln Papers  returned to Washington, D.C., and Nicolay and Hay used them in the research and  writing of their ten-volume biography, <em>Abraham Lincoln: A History</em> (New  York, 1890). Robert Todd Lincoln deposited the Lincoln Papers with the Library  of Congress in 1919, and deeded them to the Library on January 23, 1923. The  deed stipulated that the Lincoln Papers remain sealed until twenty-one years  after Robert Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s death. On July 26, 1947, the Lincoln Papers were  officially opened to the public. </p>  <p>The most complete account  of the early history of the Abraham Lincoln Papers appears in volume 1 of David  C. Mearns, <em>The Lincoln Papers</em> (Garden City, N.Y., 1948), 3-136. An  article by the same author which appeared in the December 1947 issue of the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/alajournals/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Abraham Lincoln Quarterly</em> <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> contains the substance of the story.

Reproductions of documents held by the National Archives are not  represented on this online collection, nor are published materials. Original  items contained in Series 4 are included in this online collection and include  letters written by Abraham Lincoln, an autobiographical sketch written in 1859  at the request of Jesse W.

Oversize  facsimiles and reproductions were not included in the online presentation.</p>  <p><strong>Transcriptions Included on  this Website</strong></p>  <p> Transcriptions are included for about 10,000  items (about half of the online collection). The Lincoln Studies Center at Knox  College in Galesburg, Illinois performed the editorial work, which included  selecting the documents to be transcribed. &nbsp;Their choices were based on  either a document's historical importance or as representative of the  president&rsquo;s unsolicited incoming mail. Annotated transcriptions were provided  for all of the documents in Lincoln's own hand and for secretarial copies of  Lincoln documents located in Series 1-3 of the Lincoln Papers.&nbsp;Many of the  other transcriptions were also annotated to aid users in identifying the people  involved and in better understanding the content and historical contexts.&nbsp;Annotations for Lincoln's  autograph documents usually include a headnote providing historical and  documentary context, as well as annotations on the content of the document.  Annotations for incoming correspondence typically identify persons and  organizations writing to Lincoln or referred to in the documents, explain terms  and events, and provide brief historical context. Together, these fully  searchable transcriptions and annotations dramatically extend access to the  Abraham Lincoln Papers and enhance their teaching and research value.

On December 8, 1941 (the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor),  Alan Lomax, then \"assistant in charge\" of the Archive of American Folk  Song (now the American Folklife Center archive), sent a telegram to  fieldworkers in ten different localities across the United States,  asking them to collect \"man-on-the-street\" reactions of ordinary Americans to the bombing of  Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States.  A second series of interviews, called \"Dear Mr. President,\" was recorded in  January and February 1942. Both collections are included in this  presentation. They feature a wide diversity of opinion concerning the war and other social and  political issues of the day, such as racial prejudice and labor  disputes. The result is a portrait of everyday life in America as the United States entered World War II.</p>  <figure class=\"image-align-right\">   <img src=\"/static/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/images/pseeger.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" />   <figcaption>Pete Seeger playing banjo, 1948.

Reproduction Number LC-USZ62-124417.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>The 1941 recordings were made as a part of the the Library of Congress' Radio Research  Project. A portion of this project aimed to create documentary recordings of Americans from around the country  who described their lives, sang their songs, and told the stories of their  own regions. The project's staff believed that most commercial radio  broadcasts of the day were dominated by programs created in the great  urban centers and that these programs failed to reflect regional culture, local talent, and, in particular, the voices  of the people speaking in their own words. Alan Lomax was  serving as folklore consultant for the project when he sent the December 8, 1941 telegram, asking fieldworkers to collect  \"man-on-the-street\" reactions.  This request resulted in approximately four and one  half hours of recordings that were used to create a fifteen-minute radio program for  the Mutual Broadcasting System. </p>  <p>A second set of recordings, in which the interviewees were asked to  address their thoughts and opinions on the attack and the declaration of  war directly to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was made under the auspices of the  Office of Emergency Management in January and February 1942. These  recordings total approximately seven and one half hours and were also used to create a  radio program, entitled \"Dear Mr. President,\" which was broadcast in May  1942.  Pete Seeger and <a href=\"/item/2007660385/\">Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly)</a> recorded original songs for the \"Dear Mr. President\" interviews.  Included in this presentation are Pete Seeger's \"Dear Mr. President\" and \"The Martins and Coys.\"</p>  <p>In most cases,  the recordings were digitized by Library of Congress staff directly from  the discs on which they were originally recorded. The only editing redacted  interviewee names from several recordings and removed Leadbelly's two  songs for which permissions have not yet been received. Otherwise, the recordings are  presented as they were originally recorded.</p>  <p>This online presentation includes one essay: \"Making and Maintaining  the Original Recordings.\" Also included are biographies of the  fieldworkers who conducted and arranged the interviews, complete transcripts of the  interviews, related manuscripts, and original disc sleeves.  </p>  <p>This online presentation also includes a set of interviews conducted in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. During the course of these interviews, Library interviewers advised some interviewees that the interviews would not be broadcast. Presumably, the agreement to safeguard the identity of these persons was intentional, as some of the interviewees worked for the Federal government and/or otherwise required anonymity in order to participate. For this reason, the Library has edited the Washington, D.C., audiotapes and transcripts to remove interviewee names.</p>  <p>This  presentation was made possible with the generous support of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt  Institute and the New Deal Network.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:20.044Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:42.747Z", "date": "1941", "shelf_id": "~/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 139, "dates": ["1941-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1942-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/interviews-following-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/pearl/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections//"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["https://www.loc.gov/collections/alan-lomax-manuscripts/about-this-collection/"], "medium": ["845 linear feet (330,000 manuscripts, 6400 sound recordings, 5500 graphic images, 6000 moving images)"], "date": "1933", "repository": ["Library of Congress Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, 101 Independence Ave. S.E., Washington, DC USA 20540-4610 http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.afc/folklife.home"], "contributors": ["Lomax, Alan, 1915-2002, collector.", "Archive of American Folk Song.", "American Folklife Center.", "Association for Cultural Equity."], "title": "Alan Lomax collection,", "notes": ["Alan Lomax collection (AFC 2004/004), Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress.", "Manuscripts and visual materials from the Alan Lomax Collection are available online https://www.loc.gov/collections/alan-lomax-manuscripts/about-this-collection/", "Association for Cultural Equity; 2004.", "Alan Lomax, folklorist, ethnomusicologist, born Jan. 15, 1915, Austin, Texas; died July 19, 2002, Safety Harbor, Florida."], "format": ["manuscript", "collection"], "rights_advisory": ["Duplication of the collection materials may be governed by copyright and other restrictions."], "related_items": [{"url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/alan-lomax-manuscripts/articles-and-essays/lomax-family-collections/", "title": "Essay on Alan Lomax and family collections"}], "language": ["eng", "fre"], "subjects": ["Lomax, Alan,--1915-2002--Ethnomusicological collections", "Lomax, Alan,--1915-2002--Correspondence", "Arensberg, Conrad M.--(Conrad Maynadier),--1910-1997--Correspondence", "Bartenieff, Irmgard--Correspondence", "Berkowitz, Norman--Correspondence", "Birdwhistell, Ray L.,--1918-1994--Correspondence", "Biskin, Andy--Correspondence", "Child, Irvin L.--(Irvin Long),--1915-2000--Correspondence", "Elder, J.

The online version contains 4,695 items (equaling about 51,500 images), consists of correspondence, scientific notebooks, journals, blueprints, articles, and photographs documenting Bell's invention of the telephone and his involvement in the first telephone company, his family life, his interest in the education of the deaf, and his aeronautical and other scientific research. Dates span from 1862 to 1939, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1865 to 1920. Included among Bell's papers are pages from his experimental notebook from March 10, 1876, describing the first successful experiment with the telephone, during which he spoke through the instrument to his assistant the famous words, \"Mr. Watson--Come here--I want to see you.\" Bell's various roles in life as teacher, inventor, celebrity, and family man are covered extensively in his papers. Complementing the Bell Papers are digital images of photographs from the Gilbert H. Grosvenor Collection in the Library's Prints and Photographs Division.</p> <p>The Bell Family Papers is divided into several archival series, including Family Papers, General Correspondence, Subject File, <em>Beinn Bhreagh Recorder</em>, Laboratory Notebooks, Article File, and Speech File.

Their various subjects include Bell's childhood, aeronautics, deaf   education, and scientific experiments. </li>   <li><a href=\"/search/?q=&fa=partof%3Aalexander+graham+bell+family+papers%2C+1834-1974.%3A+miscellany&sb=date\"><strong>Miscellany</strong></a><br />     This last series is composed of miscellaneous writings and copies   of correspondence, mostly by Alexander Graham Bell. There is also some   poetry, written both by and for Bell. </li> </ul> <p>Several factors defined the selection of Bell Papers for digitization. The collection as a whole includes the personal papers of not only Alexander Graham Bell but also those of his father, mother, wife, father-in-law, and other family members. Because the Bell Papers are so numerous and inclusive, navigation through them can be difficult. Therefore, one of the main objectives of the selection process was to identify those materials which mainly focused on Alexander Graham Bell and his work, varied interests, and achievements. Another important goal was to choose those materials that best offered a well-rounded portrayal of Bell--not only as an inventor and scientist but also as a teacher, husband, and father. Items were also selected if they appeared historically useful or significant, such as correspondence pertaining to the development of the Bell Telephone Company or Mabel Hubbard Bell's written accounts of her experiences growing up deaf. </p> <p> The Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers were donated to the Library of Congress by his heirs in 1975. Prior to this donation, the papers were on deposit at the National Geographic Society, where they were organized and maintained. In order to make the collection easier to use, the Society prepared typed transcripts of a large portion of the handwritten letters. These valuable transcriptions were retained and have been reproduced here along with the original letters. Occasionally the original is missing and only the transcription is still available. One should keep in mind that these transcripts are now decades old and may occasionally be difficult to read due to faded, bleeding, or blurred text.</p> <p> The Bell Papers contain a considerable amount of correspondence, much of which reflects the writing practices of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As letter writing becomes less popular, some awareness of common, older practices may be helpful. Since the typical handwritten letter is essentially a single sheet of paper folded in half (and usually written on all four sides), the digital scan and display of each unfolded sheet usually show an image of pages four and one (or back and front), and another of pages three and two (or the inside two pages). <a href=\"/resource/magbell.03500220/seq-1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Today's readers also should be aware of such papers-saving tactics as writing-over, or text over text. In such cases, the writer would literally write over a completed page, making the added words somewhat readable by turning the page sideways and writing horizontally against what were now vertical written lines. <a href=\"/resource/magbell.02800127/?sp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Surprisingly, if the writer was careful and lengthened his or her hand while also trying to write only in the spaces between lines, such letters can be read with little difficulty. </p>  <div class=\"i_aligncenter i_caption\"      style=\"width: 444px;\"> <a href=\"/item/magbellbib000925\"><img

The collection, consisting of approximately 12,000 items dating from 1708 to 1917, documents Hamilton's impoverished Caribbean boyhood (scantily); events in the lives of his family and that of his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton; his experience as a Revolutionary War officer and aide-de-camp to General George Washington; his terms as a New York delegate to the Continental Congress (1782-1783) and the Constitutional Convention (1787); and his careers as a New York state legislator, United States treasury secretary (1789-1795), political writer, and lawyer in private practice. Most of the papers date from 1777 until Hamilton's death in 1804.

They were transferred from the State Department to the Library of Congress in 1904. Additional papers came to the Library of Congress later through gifts and purchases from the Hamilton family and other sources. \u00a0Papers accumulated through 1981 were scanned from the microfilm edition made that year, and items acquired since were digitized from the originals.</p>  <p>Between 1961 and 1987, Columbia University Press published a twenty-seven-volume edition of the <em>Papers of Alexander Hamilton</em>, edited by Harold C. Syrett. Between 1964 and 1981, Columbia University Law School published a five-volume-edition of Hamilton's legal papers, with Julius Goebel as editor. These two editions have been used as definitive sources in the verification of names and in the dating and identification of manuscripts in the Hamilton Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>  <p>Although this collection is the largest gathering of Alexander Hamilton papers at the Library of Congress, there are significant additional groups of Hamilton letters and other papers in other Library of Congress collections, notably in the <a href=\"/collections/george-washington-papers/about-this-collection/\">George Washington Papers</a>.

It ends with his last letters to his wife before his death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July 1804.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+speeches+and+writings+file%2C+1778-1804\">Speeches and Writings, 1778-1804</a> (Reels 21-23)</strong><br>    Drafts, copies, and notes of reports; political essays, speeches, New York legislative acts, and more composed by Hamilton from the American Revolution until his death. Of note is an outline of the speech he delivered at the Constitutional Convention on June 18, 1787; his notes on debates and speeches at New York's ratifying convention, June 1788; drafts of the four major economic reports he wrote as treasury secretary (on public credit, creation of a national bank, establishment of a mint, and development of manufacturing); drafts of the speeches he wrote for George Washington, including Washington's 1796 farewell address; notes he took at New York's constitutional convention of 1787; and drafts of some of his political essays. None of Hamilton's <em>Federalist</em> essays are included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+legal+file%2C+1708-1804\">Legal File, 1708-1804</a> (Reels 23-29)</strong><br>    Papers documenting Hamilton's career as a lawyer, which began in 1782. Most of these are ordered alphabetically by case. Some of the landmark cases included in his papers are Rutgers v. Waddington, People v. Croswell, Hylton v. United States, and cases forming the LeGuen v. Gouverneur and Kemble litigation.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+financial+papers%2C+1782-1804\">Financial Papers, 1782-1804</a> (Reel 29)</strong><br>    The financial papers, which form the smallest segment of the collection, consist of two volumes of accounts relating to Hamilton's law practice, and a folder of miscellaneous receipts. Some of the receipts are for money Hamilton paid engineer William Pearce on behalf of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures to provide machinery for manufacturing cotton, 1791-1792.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+family+papers%2C+1737-1917\">Family Papers, 1737-1917</a></strong>  (Reels 29-31)</strong><br>    Letters and other documents of members of the Hamilton, Schuyler, and related families, but not including Alexander Hamilton himself.

Through the marriage of Philip Hamilton to Rebecca McLane, several McLane family letters were incorporated into the papers. Most of the nonfamily correspondence of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton relates to the management of her properties and to arrangements for the publication of Hamilton's papers. Scattered letters addressed to Alexander Hamilton (Alexander and Elizabeth's grandson), James A. Hamilton, John Church Hamilton, and to members of the McLane family are also included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+miscellany%2C+1711-1820\">Miscellany, 1711-1820</a> (Reels 31-34)</strong><br>    A mixture of original and copied documents.

Originals include a letter from Nicholas Everton to Hamilton concerning  legal matters and a Treasury Department circular. Photocopied material includes  letters by Hamilton, miscellaneous images, and a page from a church register  recording his marriage.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+2017+addition%2C+1790-1804\">  2017 Addition, 1790-1804</a></a></strong> <br>       This series consists of fifty-five letters, originally owned by Hamilton  descendants, purchased by the Library of Congress at Sotheby's in January 2017.  Fifty-one of these, 1790-1804, are from Philip Schuyler (1733-1804) to his  son-in-law Alexander Hamilton and daughter Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. The  remainder consists of two additional family letters, a letter from Charles  Pierre L'Enfant to Hamilton, July 14, 1801, concerning L'Enfant's renovation of  City Hall in New York into Federal Hall, and a fragment of a will in Hamilton's  hand, [July 1795].     </li>   <li><strong>Oversize</strong><br>    Correspondence, reports, annotated drafts of the Constitution, writings, deeds, agreements, contracts, financial papers, certificates, and printed matter.

Both of these collections have printed catalogs available in the Motion Picture and Television Reading Room at the Library. The films were selected from these two collections on the basis of the activities pictured in the films and the quality of the available prints. As many different types of work, school, and leisure activities as could be found were sought in order to show the broadest possible representation of activities at the turn of the century. The selection is limited, however, by what is available from these collections; not every possible occupation or leisure activity from the turn of the century is represented. </p> <p>The films in the Paper Print Collection were deposited for copyright from 1894 to 1912 as positive pictures on paper. Many were deposited in this manner on paper rolls frame by frame. For preservation and access purposes, the Library of Congress has made 16mm prints of these Paper Print titles, and has more recently been making 35mm prints of selected titles. For this presentation, 35mm and 16mm prints have been used as the original source material for digitization. Many of the 35mm prints have been produced especially for this Web presentation. </p> <p>The George Kleine Collection consists of films obtained by film distributor and producer George Kleine. The collection includes films produced from 1898 to 1926, representing films by the Edison Company, French and Italian imports, and those produced by Kleine.

Washington, D.C.    Charles A. Anderson.    Rare Book &amp; Special Collections Division, Library of Congress</figcaption> </figure> <p>For most of the nineteenth century, before the advent of phonograph  and radio technologies, Americans learned the latest songs from printed  song sheets.  Not to be confused with sheet music, song sheets are  single printed sheets, usually six by eight inches, with lyrics but no  music.  These were new songs being sung in music halls or new lyrics to  familiar songs.  Some of America's most beloved tunes were printed as  song sheets, including \"The Star Spangled Banner\" and \"Battle Hymn of  the Republic.\"  Song sheets are an early example of a mass medium and  today they offer a unique perspective on the political, social, and  economic life of the time, especially during the Civil War.  Some were  dramatic, some were humorous; all of them had America joining together  in song. </p>  <p>Song sheets first found popularity in the British Isles as early as  the 1500s, but their popularity in the United States skyrocketed in the  early nineteenth century, fueled by the introduction of the mechanized  printing press.  Historically, sheets had been printed in editions of  fewer than one hundred copies, on hand presses, using type that had been  manually set.  The new technology of the industrial age allowed runs of  more than one thousand copies, using engraved illustrations and  \"plates\" of text that were often bought and sold among publishers.</p>  <h2 class=\"clear-block\">Printing and Publishing Song Sheets</h2> <p>Printers used the \"relief\" method of printing, in which the  raised portion of the plate is inked and used to make the impression.   If by chance an intaglio plate is used, one in which the carved-out  portion provides an image, the <a href=\"/item/amss.cw106960\">effect</a> is not what the printer or reader might expect. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\">  <a href=\"/resource/amss.hc00032b\"><img src=\"/static/collections/nineteenth-century-song-sheets/images/200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" /></a>  <figcaption><a href=\"/item/amss.hc00032b\">Welcome, Mother</a>.    New York.    Charles Magnus. Rare Book &amp; Special Collections Division,  Library of Congress</figcaption> </figure> <p>Publishers who chose to include an illustration on a song sheet would  typically select from the illustrated vignettes owned by the printing  house.  These depicted <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00011c\">political and military figures</a>, <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00007c\">pastoral and industrial landscapes</a>, <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00010c\">scenes of battles</a>, and <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00016a\">social settings</a>.   Sometimes printers used generic illustrations if nothing else was  available.  For example, the song, \"Welcome Mother,\" is decorated with  an illustration of the <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00032b\">White House</a>.  The illustrations were sometimes colored, either by hand or with pre-cut blocks.</p> <p>Many songs sheets employ the use of illustrative borders, usually cut  from wood, that could be used to frame almost any plate of text.  These  frames usually include the printer's imprint and street address. A song  sheet published by H. DeMarsan provides an <a href=\"/item/amss.sb10140a\">example</a>.  Printers could use one of their own borders to frame the text acquired  from a different printer.  This interchangeability further encouraged  the migration of plates between publishing houses.</p> <p>The date of publication seldom appears on song sheets, but it can  sometimes be estimated quite accurately using a knowledge of a  publisher's history, including changes in address and company name.  For  example, the prolific publisher J. H. Johnson was known with and  without his initials, and set up shop in various locales throughout  Philadelphia. </p>  <h2>The Popularity of Song Sheets</h2> <figure class=\"image-align-left\">  <a href=\"/resource/amss.as202070\"><img src=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/media/loc.rbc.amss.as202070/001a.tif/128\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" /></a>  <figcaption><a href=\"/item/amss.as202070\">The Last Potato</a>.    New York.    H. De Marsan.    Rare Book &amp; Special Collections Division, Library of Congress<br />  </figcaption> </figure> <p>The proliferation of the mechanized printing press coincided with  a period of expanding industrialization, immigration, and commerce in  America.  The relative ease and low cost of producing song sheets met  the demand of a nation eager for a means of expression.  By the height  of their popularity, song sheets could be found almost everywhere.  They  were distributed in town squares, taverns, homes, and around camp  fires.  They are evidence of a country desiring to be heard, as well as  to listen.</p> <p>Perhaps most of all, there was a desire to sing with others.  Often  the song sheets provided new lyrics to a familiar song, like \"Yankee  Doodle,\" or \"Just Before the Battle, Mother.\"  Other sheets offered the  lyrics of popular new songs.  Among these, the byline commonly named the  performer who sang the song, and where it was performed.  \". . . To  great acclaim,\" they often boast.  \"Performed to swells of applause.\"  A  modern reader can assume that a degree of hyperbole is present in such  proclamations.  In spite of this, these rave reviews often hold clues  about the original arrangements.  Though the sheets do not include  musical notation, a byline mentioning a performance by a \"celebrated  banjoist\" gives a hint of what patrons heard and saw in the music hall.</p>  <h2>The Diversity of Song Sheets</h2> <figure class=\"image-align-right\">  <a href=\"/resource/amss.hc00005d\"><img src=\"/static/collections/nineteenth-century-song-sheets/images/hc00005d.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" /></a>  <figcaption><a href=\"/item/amss.hc00005d\">Let Me Kiss Him For His Mother</a>.    New York.    Charles Magnus.    Rare Book &amp; Special Collections Division, Library of Congress<br />  </figcaption> </figure> <p>Many songs were written purely for entertainment.  There are  songs of love and songs of death.  There were parodies of songs already  well known and loved.  \"<a href=\"/item/amss.as202070\">The Last Potato</a>,\" a culinary monologue to a tuber, is a parody of \"The Last Rose of Summer.\"  There are tall tales such as \"<a href=\"/item/amss.sb20237b\">Jack Muggins, or, the Donkey Balancer</a>,\" about a farmer and his talented donkey.</p> <p>Other song sheets were dramatic and serious.  There are cautionary maxims about the <a href=\"/item/amss.sb30341b\">hazards of alcohol</a>, and <a href=\"/item/amss.sb30355b\">critical responses</a> to the temperance movement.  There are songs of heartbreak.  And of  particular importance, there are songs about the Civil War, composed,  performed, and published as events unfolded.  Songs profess loyalty or  disdain for statesmen and military leaders.  They celebrate the <a href=\"/item/amss.cw101000\">bravery</a> of individual regiments.  They track shifting dominion throughout the  course of the war, and report on specific battles, such as <a href=\"/item/amss.hc00034b\">Antietam</a>, <a href=\"/item/amss.cw100460\">Bull Run</a>, and <a href=\"/item/amss.cw100500\">Spotsylvania</a>.</p> <p>As well as reporting the facts of the war, some songs documented  civilian attitudes toward it.  These attitudes range from highly  patriotic to guardedly hesitant.  Songs like \"<a href=\"/item/amss.sb40573b\">We Are Coming, Father Abraham</a>\" are rallying cries.  Others are less straightforward.  \"<a href=\"/item/amss.cw101470\">Don't Draft Me, My Wife Has Got a Sick Baby, I Have to Stay Home to Give It Catnip Tea</a>\" may express reluctance, or, if played for laughs, may subtly underscore the importance of patriotism. </p> <p> The patriotic muse is rarely so subtle in the mid-nineteenth century.  Many of the Civil War songs are heavy with melodrama.  \"<a href=\"/item/amss.hc00017c\">Mother Kissed Me in My Dream</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/item/amss.hc00005d\">Let Me Kiss Him for His Mother</a>\" tugged at the heartstrings, and had the power to strengthen the spirit of citizens on both sides of the war.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The variety of subjects and viewpoints conveyed by song sheets  make them a unique and indispensable historical resource.  The title of  this digital collection comes from Walt Whitman's poem \"I Hear America  Singing.\"  It was published in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, at a time when  song sheets were enjoying immense popularity.

The list begins with a rare late fifteenth-century source, <em>Les basses danses de Marguerite d'Autriche </em> (c.1490) and ends with Ella Gardner's 1929 <em>Public dance halls,  their regulation and place in the recreation of adolescents</em>. Along with dance instruction manuals, this online presentation also  includes a significant number of antidance manuals, histories,  treatises on etiquette, and items from other <a href=\"/collections/dance-instruction-manuals-from-1490-to-1920/articles-and-essays/western-social-dance-an-overview-of-the-collection/conceptual-categories\">conceptual categories</a>. Many of the manuals also provide historical information on theatrical dance.  All illuminate the manner in which people have joyfully expressed themselves as they dance for and with one another. </p> <p>Library of Congress staff selected this set of materials relating to ballroom (also called social) dance from various divisions and collections in the Library.  Selections came from the General Collections, the Music Division, and the Rare Book and Special Collections Division.  Hence, this web presentation is the only existing version of this special subject collection.  Why these dance materials are in various locations throughout the Library is in itself a history of dance in the United States. </p> <p> It has long been a goal of the Library's dance specialists and of scholars using the collections to one day provide an annotated bibliography to these dance materials that would pull together, intellectually, what has for so long been physically divided.  Finally, through the use of new technology we have been able to do far more than simply identify and describe these materials.  We have been able to bring the vast majority of these materials to the user in their entirety, and in most cases we have also been able to provide full text searching capability.  These tools will assist scholars in the analysis and study of the manuals in ways that have never been possible before.  This Web access of the dance instructions will also allow dancers around the world to download and learn these dances, which up until now, were only available to the dedicated scholar who searched several catalogs at the Library of Congress or at other libraries in New York, Paris, or London. </p> <p> No selection is ever complete or perfect.  Inevitably inclusions and exclusions must be made for a whole list of practical reasons, unrelated to an item's presence or absence from our collections.  Please forgive the exclusion of your favorite manual or treatise.  We invite the user to locate additional manuals and treatises in their local libraries, on other Web sites, or even in their grandma's attic. </p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:20.044Z",

The majority of the compositions chosen by the American Choral Directors Association are from the A. P. Schmidt Company Archives, one of the most valuable resources for the study of American choral music. This archive of music occupies a special place in the history of American music publishing. In 1958, the publisher Summy-Birchard bought out the Arthur P. Schmidt Company, and both principals agreed to donate the Schmidt papers to the Library of Congress. Included in the large deposit of business papers and financial records were numerous containers of music manuscripts, including many holographs, and printed sheet music. The A. P. Schmidt Company Archives contains over 300 boxes of manuscripts and published choral music, including the music of Arthur Foote, George Whitefield Chadwick, Horatio Parker, and John Knowles Paine. Because Schmidt championed the music of women, the collection is also rich in the holdings of holographs and sheet music of Amy Beach, Mabel Wheeler Daniels, Margaret Ruthven Lang, Florence Newell Barbour, Marion Bauer, Helen Hopekirk, Gena Branscomb, and Anna Pricella Rischer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu2005.wp.0035\" class=\"ar-more\">View a finding aid for the A.

The recordings include speech samples, linguistic interviews, oral histories, conversations, and excerpts from public speeches. They were drawn from various archives, and from the private collections of fifty collectors, including linguists, dialectologists, and folklorists. They were submitted to the Center for Applied Linguistics as part of a project entitled &quot;A Survey and Collection of American English Dialect Recordings,&quot; which was funded by the Center for Applied Linguistics and the National Endowment for the Humanities. </p>  <p>The collection includes recordings from forty-three states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and parts of Canada. They were made from 1941 to 1984, with the bulk being recorded between 1968 and 1982. In some cases, transcripts (and partial transcripts) made by the collectors are available as part of this web presentation. The survey's documentation covers social aspects of English language usage in different regions of the United States. It reveals distinctions in speech related to gender, race, social class, education, age, literacy, ethnic background, and occupational group (including the specialized jargon or vocabulary of various occupations). The oral history interviews are a rich resource on many topics, such as storytelling and family histories; descriptions of holiday celebrations, traditional farming, schools, education, health care, and the uses of traditional medicines; and discussions of race relations, politics, and natural disasters such as floods. </p>  <p>In 1983, The Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL), under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, initiated the &quot;Survey and Collection of American English Dialect Recordings,&quot; which was undertaken to compile a directory of American speech samples, and ultimately to improve access to them. There were two parts to the project. The first part surveyed collectors of speech samples and resulted in a report entitled &quot;<a href=\"//www.loc.gov:8082/static/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/images/collectionguide.pdf\">American English Speech Recordings: A Guide to Collections</a>&quot; (PDF, 3MB) which describes over 200 collections. The second part of the project was designed to select from the 200 collections a representative sample of recordings with the goal of &quot;creating a centralized source of American dialect samples and to provide for the preservation of this valuable resource that might otherwise be lost.&quot;  Additional information about the project may be found in &quot;<a href=\"//www.loc.gov:8082/static/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/images/report.pdf\">A Survey and Collection of American English Dialect Recordings</a>&quot; (PDF, 6.1MB). </p>  <p>The recordings from the project's second phase were donated to the Library of Congress in May 1986, and comprise the Center for Applied Linguistics Collection (AFC 1986/022). The collection contains speech samples from over 50 collectors. There are 405 recordings which average about 15 minutes in length. In addition to providing a wide variety of material for the study of American speech, the recordings capture a diverse range of topics and people.</p>  <p>Some of the voices will be quite familiar, such as those of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.  Other voices, despite the speakers' fame, are seldom heard, such as those of Amelia Earhart, Jack Dempsey, and H. L. Mencken. Most of the recordings, however, are of the voices of people whose specific identities are unknown, but whose comments represent the richness of the American experience. There are Gullah speakers from coastal South Carolina, sharecroppers from Arkansas, Puerto Rican teenagers in New York City, Basque sheepherders from Colorado, Chesapeake Bay watermen, Vietnamese immigrants from Northern Virginia, and many others.</p>  <p>A selection of 350 of the collection's entire 405 audio recordings are available on this website; of these, 148 have accompanying transcripts. The remaining recordings, which could not be posted due to copyright issues and other restrictions, may be heard in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/folklife/address.html\">Folklife Reading Room</a>.</p>  <p>Users may notice that descriptive data for the website varies from recording to recording. That is a result of the collection containing material from a wide variety of collectors. The data presented, for the most part, is that which was supplied by the collector. </p>  <p></p>  <p><br>  </p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "date": "1935", "shelf_id": "~/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 505, "dates": ["1941-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1942-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1943-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1944-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1945-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1946-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1947-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1948-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1949-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1950-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1951-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1952-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1953-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1954-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1955-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1956-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1957-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1958-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1959-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1960-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1961-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1962-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1963-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1964-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1965-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1966-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1967-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1968-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1969-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1971-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1972-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1973-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1974-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1975-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1976-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1977-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1978-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1979-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1980-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1981-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1982-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1983-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1984-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1935-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2008700387"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-english-dialect-recordings-from-the-center-for-applied-linguistics/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/dialect/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2008700387", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2008700387/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000094", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms011070", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms011070.3"], "medium": ["172,300 items.", "354 containers.", "341 microfilm reels.", "90.3 linear feet."], "repository": ["Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home"], "contributors": ["American Federation of Labor."], "title": "American Federation of Labor records,", "notes": ["American Federation of Labor Records available through the Library of Congress Web site at http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000094", "Microfilm edition of volumes 1-355 (volumes 251, 310, & 313 not received by the Library of Congress) available, no. 13,745.", "Microfilm edition of volumes. 356-357 available, no. 16,178.", "Microfilm produced from originals in the Manuscript Division.

The project  originated with St. Louis attorney Guy Golterman (1879-1967), an active  supporter of the opera and other performing arts.  With the endorsement  of the Department of State's Committee on Public Information -- a  governmental <em>propaganda ministry</em> --  the Nation's Forum sought  speakers, and the Columbia Graphophone Company pressed and distributed  the recordings under the Nation's Forum label. </p>  <p> The recordings fall into two distinct series.  The 1918 series was  devoted mostly to World War I topics and was apparently distributed only  to political organizations and other groups.  The notable exception is  the recording of General John Pershing (with Ambassador James Gerard  speaking on the reverse side), which was sold commercially.  All of the  recordings from the 1918 series were pressed on ten-inch discs.  The  1919-1920 series was devoted mostly to postwar issues and the 1920  presidential election.  Recordings in this series were released at a  rate of two per month, one Republican and one Democrat.  The recordings  were pressed on twelve inch discs and sold for two dollars each.  With  two exceptions, the reverse side of the records in both series consisted  of patriotic music, usually a march.  These selections are not  duplicated here. </p>  <p> The Nation's Forum project may also have planned to record foreign  statesmen.  The collection includes three speeches by Eamonn DeValera,  who led the fight to establish the Republic of Ireland.  At the time of  the recordings, DeValera had escaped from an English prison and was  living in exile in the United States.  The label of one DeValera  recording states that with the sale of each album, a royalty of  twenty-five cents would be paid to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the revolutionary Irish  Parliament. </p>  <p> The speeches included in the Nation's Forum collection are not <em>actuality</em> recordings -- recorded at the time of their original delivery.   Instead, speakers were invited to repeat their significant orations for  the Nation's Forum project at a location convenient to the particular  speaker.  All of the Nation's Forum recordings were acoustically made.   Until the development in the mid-1920's of <em>electrical</em> recordings  -- recording aided by microphones and electrical amplifiers during the  recording process, and electrical amplification and loudspeakers for  playback -- all sound recording processes were <em>acoustic.</em> The  diaphragm and needle cutting an acoustic record were powered only by the  force of a voice.  A speaker making a record had to shout into a  recording horn to successfully record.  Thus, almost no speeches  recorded in the acoustic era are <em>actuality</em> recordings.  All of  the speeches recorded for the Nation's Forum were delivered solely for  the recording machine, without a public audience.  Since phonograph  records in this period were limited to about three minutes, someone --  presumably the speaker -- abridged or selected highlights from longer  speeches.  Some speeches are represented by two or three very similar <em>takes.</em></p>  <p> The total number of recordings made by the Nation's Forum is unknown.   The Library of Congress holds fifty-nine examples in a collection that  has been assembled over a period of years from a variety of donors and  record collectors.  Of the fifteen 1918 recordings at the Library of  Congress, the Pershing/Gerard record is an original shellac disc, eleven  records are modern vinyl test pressings struck from original masters,  and two recordings are audio tape dubs.  Of the forty-four recordings  from the 1919-1920 series at the Library of Congress, twenty-four are  original shellac discs, seventeen are modern vinyl test pressings struck  from original masters, and three are audio tape dubs. </p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:23.819Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "date": "1918", "shelf_id": "~/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 97, "dates": ["1918-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["96703617"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/world-war-i-and-1920-election-recordings/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/wwielection/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/96703617", "http://www.loc.gov/item/96703617/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsrs/collmbr.rs000001", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmbr.rs000001/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000007", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000008", "http://whatamericaate.org", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053.3"], "medium": ["409,000 items.", "1,634 containers plus 1 oversize.", "63 microfilm reels.", "637.6 linear feet."], "repository": ["Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home"], "contributors": ["United States.

Typically 2,000-15,000 words in length, the documents vary in form from narratives to dialogues to reports to case histories.  They chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others. The documents often describe the informant\u2019s physical appearance, family, education, income, occupation, political views, religion and mores. Pseudonyms are often substituted for individuals and places named in the narrative texts. The life histories comprise a small part of the larger Manuscript Division collection titled <em>United States Work Projects Administration Records</em>.</p> <h2>About the Federal Writers' Project</h2> <p>The Federal Writers' Project materials in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division are part of a larger collection titled <em>The U.S. Work Projects Administration Federal Writers' Project and Historical Records Survey</em>.        The holdings from Federal Writers' Project span the years 1889-1942   and cover a wide range of topics and subprojects.  Altogether, the   Federal Writers' holdings number approximately 300,000 items and consist   of correspondence, memoranda, field reports, notes, graphs, charts,   preliminary and corrected drafts of essays, oral testimony, folklore,   miscellaneous administrative and miscellaneous other material. </p> <p>Well over one-half of the materials in this record group pertain to the <em>American Guide</em>,   the sobriquet for the critically acclaimed state guides.  The remainder   of the material reflects other areas of interest that developed as the   project grew in maturity.  They include a rich collection of rural and   urban folklore; first-person narratives (called life histories)   describing the feelings of men and women coping with life and the   Depression; studies of social customs of various ethnic groups;   authentic narratives of ex-slaves about life during the period of   Slavery; and Negro source material gathered by project workers.  In   addition, drafts of publications and intended publications are included.    These publications express concern with the direction America was   taking and with the preservation and communication of local culture.    Titles include <em>Hands That Build America</em>, <em>From These Strains</em>, <em>Lexicon of Trade Jargon</em>, and <em>Pockets in America</em>. </p> <p>The arrangement of the larger collection generally reflects the   division of work within the Writers' Project such as material relating   to <em>The American Guide</em>, the Folklore Project, Social-ethnic   Studies, and Slave Narratives.  Other series are compilations for   archival purposes such as administrative papers or Negro studies   material.  Still others are groups of similar material such as printed   matter and the like. </p> <p>The plight of the unemployed writer, and indeed anyone who could   qualify as a writer such as a lawyer, a teacher, or a librarian, during   the early years of the Depression, was of concern not only to the   Roosevelt Administration, but also to writers' organizations and persons   of liberal and academic persuasions.  It was felt, generally, that the   New Deal could come up with more appropriate work situations for this   group other than blue collar jobs on construction projects.  To the   Administration's liking were plans generated from a series of meetings   held in 1934 between Jacob Baker, Harry Hopkins' chief Civil Works   Administration assistant in charge of special and professional programs,   Henry Alsberg, Bakers' assistant, Katherine Kellock, a writer familiar   with international and social organizations, and others.  The outcome of   these sessions was a project for all the \"arts,\"  (labeled Federal   One), divided administratively by each specialty and headed by   professionals in the field.  The Writers' Project, later characterized   by some as the federal government's attempt to \"democratize American   culture,\" was approved for federal monies in June, 1935.  Baker chose   his assistant, Alsberg, as director.  As the Project continued into the   late thirties, the director was powerless to stop increasing criticism   by reactionary Congressmen who were intent on shutting down the   enterprise.  In October 1939, the Project's federal monies ceased, due   to the Administration's need for a larger defense budget.  After 1939,   emasculated, the Project sputtered along on monies funded to the states,   closing completely one year or so after America's entry into World War   II. </p> <p>Researchers should note that the American Memory collection   presented here is a coherent portion of the Library's larger Federal   Writers' series and the WPA collection.  It includes the life histories   and corollary documents assembled by the <a href=\"#folklore-project\">Folklore Project</a> within the Federal Writers' effort.</p> <h2 id=\"folklore-project\">About the Folklore Project and the Life Histories</h2> <p>Within the Federal Writers' Project, material relating to   folklore and social-ethnic studies was collected and shaped through the   efforts of John A. Lomax, Benjamin A. Botkin, and Morton Royce.  The   activity documented in writing traditional statements, expressions,   songs, essays, stories, and the like, with tilt toward accounts of   frontier and pioneer life.  The Folklore Project filed its material   under the general headings \"traditional\" and \"life histories.\" </p> <p>The Writers' Project staff variously described the life histories as <em>life sketches</em>, <em>living lore</em>, <em>industrial lore</em>, and <em>occupational lore</em>.  The narratives were meant to reflect the ordinary person's struggle with the vicissitudes of daily living. <p> This American Memory presentation is limited to the Folklore Project   life histories. Similar accounts may be found in the Social-Ethnic   portion of the WPA collection; these may be digitized in the future.</p> <p>At the time, Botkin said, the collected lore and narratives   were to be used as the basis for anthologies which would form a   composite and comprehensive portrait of various groups of people in   America.  The entire body of material provides the raw content for a   broad documentary of both rural and urban life, interspersed with   accounts and traditions of ethnic group traditions, customs regarding   planting, cooking, marriage, death, celebrations, recreation, and a wide   variety of narratives.  The quality of collecting and writing lore   varies from state to state, reflecting the skills of the   interviewer-writers and the supervision they received.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:20.044Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:42.747Z", "shelf_id": "~/collections/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/", "other_title": ["U.S. Work Projects Administration records", "Work Projects Administration records", "WPA records"], "count": 2847, "dates": ["1936-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1937-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1938-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1939-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1940-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["mm82055715"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/federal-writers-project/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/federal-writers-project/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/federal-writers-project/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/fwp/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/mm82055715", "http://www.loc.gov/item/mm82055715/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000007", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmss.ms000007/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000008", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053.3", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms009053.3/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmss.ms000008/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms009053/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009053", "http://whatamericaate.org"]}, {"number_oclc": ["n1129123508"], "item": {"call_number": ["ML385"], "language": ["eng"], "contributors": ["Library of Congress.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:04:55.870Z", "date": "1996", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "other_title": ["Vaudeville and popular entertainment, 1870-1920"], "count": 726, "dates": ["1870-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1871-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1872-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1873-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1874-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1875-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1876-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1877-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1878-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1879-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1880-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1881-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1882-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1883-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1884-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1885-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1886-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1887-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1888-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1889-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1891-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1892-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1893-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1894-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1895-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1896-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["96802670"], "language": ["english"], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/var/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/varst/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-variety-stage/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/vaudeville/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/96802670", "http://www.loc.gov/item/96802670/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000048", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000048/"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "original_format": ["collection", "sound recording"], "id": "http://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "partof": ["ancestral voices", "digital collections", "american folklife center"], "subject": ["performing arts", "american history"], "index": 36, "group": ["collections-portal"], "title": "Ancestral Voices", "digitized": true, "description": ["<p>Among the very first activities of the American Folklife Center (AFC) -- created in 1976 -- was the Federal Cylinder Project (FCP), a large-scale initiative to preserve and provide access to historic and fragile field recordings captured on wax cylinders, many dating back to the late nineteenth century. The goal of the FCP (1977-1987) was to gather together thousands of such historical recordings held at the Library, in national and international repositories, at universities, and in private collections; produce catalog records; preserve the audio on reel-to-reel tape; and make the recordings available to communities of origin. In particular, the initiative focused on some 9,000 cylinder recordings of Native American cultural expressions, with the aim of sharing copies with those communities to further their work in linguistic maintenance and reclamation and ownership of cultural heritage. Between 1983 and 1988, thanks in part to a grant of $118,000 from the Ford Foundation, FCP project staff -- including scholars from the Library, the Smithsonian Institution, and public universities -- visited approximately 100 tribal communities and returned cassette copies of cylinder recordings (cassette being the most accessible format at the time).</p>  <p><em>Ancestral Voices</em> is the successor to that pioneering project and utilizes emerging digital technologies and innovative approaches to address issues in preservation, co-curation, cultural representation, and intellectual access that are of critical concern for both cultural communities and archival repositories. The project seeks to mutually benefit both tribal members and the Library of Congress in these areas:</p>  <ol type=\"a\">   <li>digital preservation of an essential element of American and Native American heritage;</li>   <li>repatriation, in digital form, of this heritage to Native American nations;</li>   <li>collaboration of the Library with tribal communities in respectful presentation of this heritage;</li>   <li>setting standards for future technical innovation and collaboration.</li>  </ol>  <p>By working with tribal communities to determine what is missing from current collection information and adding that perspective to the catalog records, this effort repositions communities as authorities over their cultural histories and heritage, paralleling the earlier efforts of the FCP. AFC sees this as central to establishing new paradigms in classification, curation, and methods of access for indigenous materials. In the areas of cataloging and curation, the <em>Ancestral Voices</em> project is piloting the use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) labels to provide community-centered perspectives to enhance the description and presentation of the digital items. TK Labels are provided by the <a href=\"http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/\" target=\"_blank\">Local Contexts <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"></i></a> platform. Tribal communities adapt and apply them to digital heritage materials (audio recordings, images, documents, etc.) in the <a href=\"http://www.mukurtu.org/learn\" target=\"_blank\">Mukurtu CMS <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"></i></a> a community content management system, in preparation for sharing community-authored information with institutional repositories, such as the Library. Labels identify culturally sensitive materials and thereby help end-users make informed decisions about how this material should be attributed and in what ways it should be used. For more information on TK Labels, see the <a href=\"/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/rights-and-access/\">Rights and Access</a> page. </p>  <p>This first presentation in the <em>Ancestral Voices</em> project is the result of a collaborative venture among the AFC, the Passamaquoddy Tribe of Maine, and the creators of TK Labels and Mukurtu CMS. Passamaquoddy elders have provided cultural narratives and added traditional knowledge about Passamaquoddy recordings, which were spoken in a French-influenced dialect of the Passamaquoddy language in 1890. We hope to expand Ancestral Voices to include other tribal groups and historic recordings in future online presentations.</p>  <p><strong>Jesse Walter Fewkes collection of Passamaquoddy cylinder recordings</strong></p>  <p>The Jesse Walter Fewkes collection of Passamaquoddy cylinder recordings was created in March 1890 when the anthropologist Fewkes travelled to Calais, Maine, to undertake one of the very first experiments in ethnographic audio documentation with the Passamaquoddy Tribe. The Passamaquoddy Tribe is one of the indigenous communities of the region and is made up of communities from Pleasant Point and Indian Township in Maine and St. Andrews, New Brunswick, in Canada. In order to prepare for his forthcoming trip on the Hemenway Southwestern Expedition, supported through the patronage of Mrs. Mary Hemenway of Boston, Fewkes field-tested a significant piece of documentation equipment in Maine. This was the wax cylinder phonograph, patented in 1878 by Thomas Alva Edison. The device became a central instrument of early documentarians as well as gaining popularity among commercial producers of audio recordings. For a history of the cylinder phonograph, <a href=\"/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\">consult this article</a>.</p>  <p>Over the course of three days, Fewkes recorded thirty-six cylinders of partial songs, legends, creation stories, and linguistic terms provided by Passamaquoddy community members, principally Peter Selmore and Newell Josephs (also spelled Noel Joseph or Noel Josephs). The short duration of recording on a cylinder, about two to three minutes, meant that only fragments of stories or songs were recorded, and the collection now contains just thirty-one cylinders because five of them were damaged. These recordings are the oldest ethnographic field recordings known to survive anywhere. Fewkes's recordings were eventually deposited in Harvard University's Peabody Museum, and then donated by the Museum to the Library of Congress in the 1970s for inclusion in the Federal Cylinder Project.</p>  <h2>About the Recordings</h2>  <p>In 2015, audio engineers at the Library's National Audiovisual Conservation Center (NAVCC) employed up-to-date technology, notably the Arch\u00e9ophone cylinder playback machine (invented in 1998 in France by Henri Chamoux) to extract the content directly from audio cylinders to digital preservation master files. The digital files were then restored and enhanced, using the Computer Enhanced Digital Audio Restoration System - CEDAR, for short. Passamaquoddy community members comment that the digitally restored recordings have significantly enhanced their comprehension of their ancestor\u2019s' voices and teachings. Accordingly, this site presents three versions of the digital files produced from each cylinder, to provide points of comparison of the restoration process: 1) a best quality enhanced audio recording; 2) a \"flat\" transfer of the cylinder to digital audio file; and 3) a digital copy of the tape recording made from the cylinder in the 1980s for the Federal Cylinder Project.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:04:55.870Z", "shelf_id": "~/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 26, "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/ancestral-voices/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/ancestral-voices/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/passamaquoddy/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu016011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu016011.3"], "call_number": ["ML31 .K65"], "contributors": ["Kostelanetz, Andre, 1901-1980."], "language": ["eng"], "title": "Andre Kostelanetz collection,", "notes": ["Organized into the following series: I.

Prominent is documentation related to his complex two-term presidency, during which the nation debated issues of nullification, tariff rates, banking procedures, Indian policy, public improvements, and the relative power and sovereignty of the individual states in the Union in relation to the federal government. The collection also contains information on military orders and court martial proceedings, diplomatic and Indian treaty negotiations, and the experiences and/or opinions of those Jackson led in battle, collaborated with or opposed in politics, or trusted as cabinet members, allies and friends.</p>  <p>Notable  correspondents represented in the Andrew Jackson Papers include Francis Preston  Blair, Willie Blount, John C.

The collection consists of approximately 10,000 items (20,221 images), most of which were digitized from 25 microfilm reels. Included are family correspondence, general correspondence, speeches and writings, a legal file, financial papers, newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, and research notes of Dickinson's biographer, Giraud Chester.</p>  <p>Dickinson was a teenage phenomenon on the antislavery lecture circuit, whose electrifying speeches made her one of the campaign&rsquo;s most sought-after speakers. In 1863, she toured the country on behalf of Republican Party candidates, and after the Civil War, she became a star of the lyceum circuit, drawing large crowds and commanding huge speaking fees. She was among the celebrities who were aboard the first transcontinental railroad trip to California and also grabbed headlines when she climbed Pike&rsquo;s Peak and other summits.\u00a0 Her familiarity with the stage later led to a less successful career as an actress and playwright.</p>  <p>Dickinson had a particularly close relationship with Susan B. Anthony and shared the latter's interest in women's rights and temperance. She also advocated for the rights of African Americans and corresponded with escaped slave and abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass as well as with other notable figures of her time.\u00a0 Although Dickinson did not retain copies of most of her correspondence, she obtained many of the letters she wrote while on national lecture tours to Mary Dickinson, her mother, and Susan Dickinson, her journalist sister. This correspondence described her travel itineraries, her impressions, and her joys and misgivings. They show the reactions of a person whose plays and performances, including <em>A Crown of Thorns </em>and <em>The Test of Honor</em>, were not well received.</p>  <p>By 1900, Dickinson was estranged from her sister Susan, formerly her closest friend and housemate, and she had outlived most of her associates. As recorded in the legal file and in her scrapbooks, she initiated several lawsuits between 1895 and 1901 as a result of her confinement at the State Hospital for the Insane in Danville, Pennsylvania. Other topics include the elections of 1872 and 1888, the Republican Party, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and education.</p>  <p>A finding aid (<a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms006005.3\">PDF</a> and <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms006005\">HTML</a>) to the Anna E.

Thornton was the daughter of Ann Brodeau, who emigrated from England in 1775 with the help of Benjamin Franklin and established a successful school in Philadelphia. The identity of Anna Maria Thornton's father is unknown, but he may have been English clergyman William Dodd, who was hanged for forgery in 1777.</p>  <p>In 1790, at just fifteen, Anna Maria Brodeau married William Thornton (1759-1828), an architect who was born in Tortola and initially trained as a doctor. He is best known for his design of the United States Capitol. Thornton was one of the commissioners appointed to plan the capital city, and later in his career he became United States Superintendent of Patents. The Thorntons moved to Washington in 1792 and lived there for the rest of their lives.</p>  <p>Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton's papers consist of diaries and commonplace books, 1793-1861, which she began when she was eighteen and ended at eighty-six, a period of sixty-eight years. These volumes document the operation of her household, including the management of slaves; travel, including visits to the Virginia homes of George and Martha Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James and Dolley Madison; the construction of Washington, D.C., and the United States Capitol; the city under attack during the War of 1812; visits of the Count de Volney, 1796, and Alexander von Humboldt, 1804; an attempt on her life by Arthur, a slave, in 1835; the 1844 shipboard explosion that killed Secretary of State Abel Upshur and Treasury Secretary Thomas Gilmer; the inauguration of president James K. Polk in 1845; and the start of the Civil War.</p>  <p>Thornton's entries show the networks of visiting and social events, including presidential \"levees,\" at which she, along with other wives of Washington's leaders, observed and influenced power in the capital city. Included are household accounts, receipts, a visitors log, 1794-1798, book lists and reading notes, essays in French and English, recipes, a collection of autographs of Washington figures, photographs, and silhouettes. Among the silhouettes are a few done by Philadelphia artist Charles Willson Peale of Humboldt and his party during their 1804 visit to Washington (volume 6).</p>  <h2>Arrangement</h2>  <p>Anna Maria Brodeau Thornton's diaries and commonplace books are grouped in seven volumes organized in chronological order, with the exception of volume 2.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English.

Its purpose was to provide the public with access to the thousands of individual songs, tunes, folk tales, sermons, monologues, and life stories in the Archive's collections.</p>  <figure class=\"image-align-right\"><img src=\"/static/collections/traditional-music-and-spoken-word/images/afccards-home.jpg\" width=\"275\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption ><em>(clockwise from top)</em>: <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.afc/afcts.p016\">Charles Todd at the recording machine surrounded by a group of Mexican boys and men</a>; <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.afc/afcts.p008 \">Will Neal playing fiddle and being recorded by Charles Todd and Robert Sonkin</a>; <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsc.00400\">Blind Willie McTell, with 12-string guitar, hotel room, Atlanta, Georgia</a>. <br/><em>(background)</em>: Sample drawer from the American Folklife Center's card catalog.

Lomax and Alan Lomax's Library of Congress collecting work (Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Jelly Roll Morton), and Alan Lomax's less well-known field collections in Haiti in 1936 to 1937 and in the upper Midwest of the United States in 1938. There are hundreds of well-known and lesser-known treasures by other notable collectors including Herbert Halpert, Zora Neale Hurston, Henrietta Yurchenco, Vance Randolph, and Helen Creighton, among many others. The catalog also reflects exchange projects with institutions outside the United States, notably the Discoteca P\u00fablica Municipal de S\u00e3o Paulo Collection (1938-1943) of field recordings from Brazil; and field recordings collected in Oceania. The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog. The researcher should also be aware that for some non-English recordings from this period, no cards were made. We hope to expand the catalog in the future and add the bibliographic data for the sound recordings that are now represented only as \"Spanish\" or \"Foreign.\"</p> <p>The physical card catalog in the Archive is searchable only by title, performer, state (if U.S.), shelflist number (AFS number), or country/language (other than English). The online version of the catalog searches these areas, plus recording dates, recordist's names, and many others. Our plans are to continue to increase access to individually recorded items in our collections and to grow this database beyond just the cards represented in this online catalog to other collections in the Archive.</p> <p>Please note that this catalog represents only a portion of our recordings; in fact the majority of the Archive's recordings are not represented here. There is also information in the catalog that is incorrect and incomplete. We are continually working to make these corrections, and to add more material to the database.

Conservation Movement, 1850-1920</em> documents  the historical formation and cultural foundations of the movement to  conserve and protect America's natural heritage, through books,  pamphlets, government documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and  motion picture footage drawn from the collections of the Library of  Congress.</p> <p> The collection consists of 62 books and pamphlets, 140 Federal statutes  and Congressional resolutions, 34 additional legislative documents,  excerpts from the <em>Congressional Globe</em> and the <em>Congressional Record</em>, 360 Presidential proclamations, 170 prints and photographs, 2 historic manuscripts, and 2 motion pictures. </p> <h2>Preface: The Early Conservation Movement in Context</h2> <p>Concern for the relationship between humans and the natural world has  been a definitive element in nearly all cultures.  In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "date": "1850", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "other_title": [], "count": 744, "dates": ["1850-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1851-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1852-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1853-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1854-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1855-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1856-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1857-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1858-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1859-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1860-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1861-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1862-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1863-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1864-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1865-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1866-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1867-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1868-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1869-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1870-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1871-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1872-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1873-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1874-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1875-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1876-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1877-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1878-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1879-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1880-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1881-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1882-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1883-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1884-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1885-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1886-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1887-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1888-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1889-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1891-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1892-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1893-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1894-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1895-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1896-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/conserve/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3"], "medium": ["25,000 items.", "95 containers plus 1 oversize.", "38 linear feet."], "repository": ["Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home"], "contributors": ["Arendt, Hannah, 1906-1975.", "Bl\u00fccher, Heinrich, 1899-1970."], "title": "Hannah Arendt papers,", "notes": ["Arranged in ten series.

The collection is organized in the following series: Family Papers,   Correspondence, Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and Writings File,   Clippings, Addition I, Addition II, and Addition III. Rich in manuscripts and   correspondence for Arendt's productive years as a writer and lecturer after   World War II, the papers are sparse before the mid-1940s because of Arendt's   forced departure from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her escape from occupied France   in 1941. Documentation for the first part of her life includes a few notebooks   and writings; several official and private records relating mainly to her   divorce, family history, and emigration; and a small group of personal   correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, some of whose letters   and unpublished writings can be found in the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/articles-and-essays/family-papers/\">Family Papers</a> series. Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Bl\u00fccher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H.

The material traces Arendt's intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt's friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt's best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt's conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader's trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial's   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt's role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant's Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt's students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt's doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt's two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>. There are also   essays and lectures in the Speeches and Writings series in addition to the   lectures and seminar notes in the Subject File folders designated \"Courses\"   Research material arranged by topic is filed under \"Extracts and Notes\" in the   Speeches and Writings series. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/mccarthy.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy, ca. 1960s.

A small group of lectures is also contained in   this addition. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder08.html\">Addition II</A> includes correspondence from Arendt to Heinrich Bl\u00fccher and a notebook kept by   Arendt's mother recording Arendt's development as a child. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder09.html\">Addition III</A> contains   additional correspondence and notes by Arendt.</p> <p>In addition to the correspondents noted above, the Arendt Papers include   letters to and from Hanan J. Ayalti (pen name of Hanan Klenbort), Walter   Benjamin, Rosalie Littell Colie, Robert and Elke Gilbert, J. Glenn Gray,   Waldemar Gurian, Rolf Hochhuth, Hans Jonas, Lotte Kohler, Judah Leon Magnes,   Hans Joachim Morgenthau, Ruth H. Rosenau, Gershom Gerhard Scholem, Paul Tillich,   Eric Voegelin, Ernst Vollrath, Anne Weil, and Helen and Kurt Wolff.</p> <p>Lotte Kohler's <em>Hannah Arendt/Heinrich Bl\u00fccher: Briefe 1936-1968</em> (M\u00fcnchen: Piper, 1996) was consulted during the arrangement of the   correspondence between Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher in the Family Papers series.   An English version of Kohler's work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000. The   photographs have been transferred to the Library's Prints and Photographs   Division where they are identified as a part of these papers. These are not   included in the online collection.</p> <p>For reference inquiries, please contact the Library of Congress <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/mss/\">Manuscript Reading Room</a>.</p> <h2 name=\"dgc\">The Digital Collection</h2> <p>In December 1998, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded the Library of   Congress a grant to support a two-year project to digitize the Hannah Arendt   Papers. The staff of the Manuscript Division at the Library administered the   project, with assistance from the National Digital Library Program (NDLP) and in   cooperation with the New School University in New York City. </p> <p>The digital version of the papers is being made available in two ways. The   collection is available in its entirety onsite at the Library of Congress and   two other research institutions. In addition, major portions of the collection   are available to the public on the Internet.</p> <h2 name=\"cdc\">Onsite Access to the Complete Digital Collection</h2> <p>The complete version of the digitized Arendt Papers (approximately 25,000   items; about 75,000 images) is available to researchers at three locations: the   reading room of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress, the New   School University\u2019s Hannah Arendt Center at the Fogelman Library, and the Hannah   Arendt Center at the University of Oldenburg, Germany. Contact these locations   for information about accessing these collections: <h3>Library of Congress Manuscript Division Reading Room</h3> <p>Manuscript Division <br />  Library of Congress <br />  101 Independence Avenue, S.E. <br />  Washington, DC 20540-4680 <br />  Email: <a href=\"mailto:mss@loc.gov\">mss@loc.gov</a> <br />  Administrative Offices: (202)   707-5383 <br />  Reading Room: (202) 707-5387 <br />  Fax: (202)   707-6336</p> <h3>The New School University</h3> <p>Jerome Kohn <br />  Hannah Arendt Center <br />  Department of Philosophy <br />  New   School University <br />  65 Fifth Avenue <br />  New York, NY 10003 <br />  Email: <a href=\"mailto:kohnj@newschool.edu\">kohnj@newschool.edu</a></p> <h3>University of Oldenburg</h3> <p>Prof. Antonia Grunenberg <br />  <a href=\"http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/arendt-zentrum/\">Hannah Arendt Zentrum</a> <br />  Carl von Ossietzky Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg, BIS <br />  Postfach 2541 <br />  26015   Oldenburg <br />  Germany <br />  Email: <a href=\"mailto:arendt-zentrum@uni-oldenburg.de\">arendt-zentrum@uni-oldenburg.de</a> <br />  Telephone: (+49) 0441/798-2258 <br />  Fax: (+49) 0441/798-5863</p> <h2 name=\"sdi\">Offsite Internet Access to Selected Digital Items</h2> <p>Internet distribution of the Hannah Arendt Papers at the Library of Congress   presented formidable copyright challenges given the quantity and complexity of   the materials involved. In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:04:55.870Z", "date": "1996", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "other_title": ["Vaudeville and popular entertainment, 1870-1920"], "count": 726, "dates": ["1870-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1871-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1872-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1873-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1874-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1875-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1876-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1877-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1878-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1879-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1880-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1881-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1882-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1883-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1884-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1885-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1886-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1887-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1888-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1889-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1891-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1892-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1893-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1894-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1895-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1896-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["96802670"], "language": ["english"], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/var/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/varst/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-variety-stage/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/vaudeville/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/96802670", "http://www.loc.gov/item/96802670/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000048", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000048/"]}, {"number_oclc": ["86114510"], "item": {"call_number": ["Z6951", "AI3"], "language": ["eng"], "contributors": ["Library of Congress.", "National Endowment for the Humanities.", "National Digital Newspaper Program (U.S.)"], "format": ["text"], "notes": ["Began in 2006.", "Title from title screen (viewed July 7, 2009).", "\"Chronicling America is sponsored jointly by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)\"--Title screen."], "title": "Chronicling America : historic American newspapers.", "summary": ["This database allows you to search and view public domain newspaper pages (1690-1963) and find information about American newspapers published between 1690-present.

NDNP, a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC), is a long-term effort to develop an Internet-based, searchable database of U.S. newspapers with descriptive information and select digitization of historic pages. Supported by NEH, this rich digital resource will be developed and permanently maintained at the Library of Congress. An NEH award program will fund the contribution of content from, eventually, all U.S. states and territories.</p> <p>More information on program guidelines, participation, and technical information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/projects/ndnp.html\">https://www.neh.gov/projects/ndnp.html</a> or <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/\">https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/</a>.</p>  <h2>Building the Digital Collection</h2> <h3>Newspaper Title Directory</h3> <p>The Newspaper Title Directory is derived from the library catalog records created by state institutions during the NEH-sponsored United States Newspaper Program (<a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html\">https://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html</a>), 1982-2011. This program funded state-level projects to locate, describe (catalog), and selectively preserve (via treatment and microfilm) historic newspaper collections in that state, published from 1690 to the present. Under this program, each institution created machine-readable cataloging (MARC) via the Cooperative ONline SERials Program (CONSER) for its state collections, contributing bibliographic descriptions and library holdings information to the Newspaper Union List, hosted by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). This data, approximately 140,000 bibliographic title entries and 600,000 separate library holdings records, was acquired and converted to MARCXML format for use in the Chronicling America Newspaper Title Directory. Contact a CONSER member for updates and corrections to bibliographic records (see <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html\">https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html</a> ) through CONSER. The Chronicling America Directory bibliographic records are updated annually from the CONSER dataset hosted by OCLC.</p> <h3>Selected Digitized Newspaper Pages</h3>  <p>Each NDNP participant receives an award to select and digitize approximately 100,000 newspaper pages representing that state's regional history, geographic coverage, and events of note. </p> <p>Participants are expected to digitize primarily from microfilm holdings for reasons of efficiency and cost, encouraging selection of technically-suitable film, bibliographic completeness, diversity and &quot;orphaned&quot; newspapers (newspapers that have ceased publication and lack active ownership) in order to decrease the likelihood of duplicative digitization by other organizations.</p> <p>These newspaper materials were digitized to technical specifications designed by the Library of Congress. These specifications include the following basic elements (profiles describing the full set of specifications can be found at <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/\">https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/</a>) : </p> <ul>     <li>TIFF 6.0, 8-bit grayscale, 400 dpi, uncompressed, with specified tag values</li>     <li>JPEG2000, Part 1; 8-bit component; 6 decomposition layers; 25 quality layers; 8:1 compression; with XML Box with specified RDF metadata</li>     <li>Single page PDF with hidden text; downsampled to 150 dpi, using JPEG compression; with XMP containing specified RDF metadata.</li>     <li>Single page machine-readable text encoded in ALTO, v. 2.0 XML; in column-reading order (created with Optical Character Recognition).</li>     <li>METS XML data objects describing newspaper issues, pages, and microfilm reels; incorporating elements in MODS, PREMIS, and MIX formats.</li> </ul>  <p>Chronicling America provides access to these digitized historic materials primarily through a Web interface enhanced with dynamic HTML interactivity for magnification and navigation. Searches are available for both full-text newspaper pages and bibliographic newspaper records (the Newspaper Directory). Pages are displayed in JPEG format, dynamically-created from source files on user request and presented through the browser interface using a combination of Javascript, DHTML and AJAX Web programming.</p> <h3>Preservation Data Repository and Dissemination Application</h3> <p>The NDNP repository developed for Chronicling America is based on the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) Reference Model for preservation repository architecture and supported by a variety of modular components to enable long-term sustainability of data ingestion, archival management and data dissemination. The public website is built using the Python programming language, Django Web framework, RDFLib, Apache Solr search server, Apache Web server, and MySQL database engine.

These items date from 1899 to 1981, with most from the 1920s through the 1950s, and were selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and\u00a0photographs.</p> <p>Celebrating the centennial of the birth of the American composer Aaron Copland (1900-1990), the multi-format Aaron Copland Collection, from which the online collection derives, spans the years 1910 to 1990 and includes approximately 400,000 items documenting the multifaceted life of an extraordinary person who was composer, performer, teacher, writer, conductor, commentator, and administrator. It comprises both manuscript and printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries, writings, scrapbooks, programs, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, awards, books, sound recordings, and motion pictures.</p>  <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Aaron Copland devoted his life as a twentieth-century composer to fostering, developing, creating, and establishing distinctive \"American\" music. He became known as the \"Dean of American Music,\" a sobriquet with which he was uncomfortable. His name is synonymous with\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0\u2014the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize in Music\u2014and\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/f/#work0021\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>.</p> <p>Copland extensively documented the many facets of his life in music, and the<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress reflects the entire breadth of his endeavors. Beginning in the late 1950s and early &lsquo;60s, Copland periodically deposited his original music manuscripts at the Library of Congress and subsequently converted them to gifts. In the fall of 1989, he donated all his papers to the Library. The collection numbers approximately four hundred thousand items, dating from 1910 to 1990 with a few nineteenth-century photographs, and includes his music manuscripts, printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries and writings, photographic materials, awards, honorary degrees, programs, and other biographical materials. It is the primary resource for research on Aaron Copland and a major resource for the study of musical life in twentieth-century America generally, particularly from the 1920s to the 1960s.</p> <p>The online\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0comprises approximately one thousand items selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and photographs. The items are represented in about five thousand digitized images, the earliest an 1899 photograph and the latest a 1986 letter. While the original collection contains almost all Copland's music manuscripts and printed scores, the online collection presents the original music sketches that Copland used in composing thirty-one works spanning the years 1924 to 1967 and covering every medium in which he composed: orchestral, ballet, opera, film, chamber, solo piano, and vocal music.</p> <p>The correspondence in the online collection comprises images of approximately eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Copland that have been selected from the Aaron Copland Collection and other collections in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0at the Library of Congress. Besides letters to his parents and other family members in the 1920s and 30s, the correspondence includes Copland's letters to his Parisian teacher Nadia Boulanger, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and others such as Nicolas Slonimsky, Roger Sessions, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Walter Piston, Leonard Bernstein, and Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>As an advocate and supporter of American music and American composers, Copland frequently wrote articles, presented lectures, and delivered speeches. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0presents eighty-six of Copland's previously unpublished drafts. These show the creative process through which he wrote about his own music, other composers and their music, and other people who played important roles in his musical life.</p> <p>Of the twelve thousand photographic materials in the Library's Aaron Copland Collection, 111 items have been chosen for online presentation. Many were created by Copland's friend Victor Kraft, a professional photographer. They include portraits of Aaron Copland at various ages and places, with family members, with other composers, and with other people associated with his career as a composer and conductor, as well as images from his worldwide travels.</p>  <h2>The Copland Letters</h2>  <p>\"The man is in the letters,\" said Vivian Perlis of Aaron Copland, whose autobiography she helped to write. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0contains digitized images of over eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland covering the years from 1921 to 1986. Searchable texts of all published letters, postcards, and telegrams in the collection are also available.</p> <p>The letters reproduced in the collection represent, though they do not exhaust, the holdings of Copland's correspondence in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0of the Library of Congress. In general they constitute significant runs of letters to people important in Copland's life. (Problems of copyright and volume preclude making letters to Copland available online.) Every attempt has been made to include all the letters in the Music Division that Copland wrote to each correspondent represented, the one exception being the letters to Harold Spivacke, which constitute only a part of Copland's voluminous and largely business-related correspondence with the Music Division's former chief.</p> <p>These letters come from many collections in the Music Division. Besides material from the Aaron Copland Collection, they contain material from the Leonard Bernstein Collection, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Collection, the Jacobo Ficher Collection, the Irving Fine Collection, the Louis Kaufman Collection, the Serge Koussevitzky Collection, the\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives, the Walter Piston Collection, the Nicolas Slonimsky Collection, the William Strickland Collection, and the papers of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music.</p> <p>The letters Copland wrote that are in the Copland Collection proper came back to him in various ways. He inherited his letters to his parents after their deaths. In the 1970s, when he began to think of writing his autobiography, he asked several of his friends and colleagues to send him photocopies of his letters. Some replied with photocopies, some by returning the letters themselves. Some responded with many letters, some with just a few.</p> <p>Copland seldom made carbons copies of his outgoing correspondence. The few periods in his life for which the Copland Collection is rich in carbon copies are the brief intervals when he had a secretary: in 1943 while working on the film\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>; during his South American tour in 1947; in the fall of 1958 when he was staying in London and presumably was provided with a secretary by his publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Because they were obviously dictated to a secretary, these letters have the flavor of Copland's post-1940 correspondence but are not particularly trenchant, lacking the distinctive qualities that came forth when Copland himself sat down to write.</p>  <p>The following individuals are the major correspondents represented in the letters portion of this online collection. They are listed with the source collection for Copland's letters to them or, in the case of material in the Copland Collection itself, with an indication of whether the letters are originals or photocopies.</p> <p><strong>Arthur Berger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopy). The online collection contains a <a href=\"/resource/copland.corr0796?sp=1\">single letter</a>\u00a0to this writer of the first book-length study of Copland; it is perhaps the most evocative of Copland's letters describing his Mexican visits.</p> <p><strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong>\u00a0(Bernstein Collection). Copland's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the late 1930s and early 1940s,\u00a0Bernstein\u00a0became one of the leading champions and interpreters of Copland's music.</p> <p><strong>Nadia Boulanger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Copland's principal teacher and mentor. His Nonet is dedicated to her.</p> <p><strong>Paul Bowles</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Composer and novelist. The two letters in the Copland Collection seem to have been part of a voluminous and regular correspondence.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). English composer. The first set of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0was written for Britten and his collaborator Peter Pears. Britten's side of the correspondence is published in Donald Mitchell et al., eds.,\u00a0<em>Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, 1913-1976\u00a0</em>(2 vols., Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).</p> <p><strong>Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). Mexican composer; one of Copland's principal composer friends. As a conductor, Ch\u00e1vez performed Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/s/#work0012\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0when American conductors had declared it unperformable. Ch\u00e1vez's side of the correspondence and slightly abridged versions of Copland's letters are published in Spanish translation in Gloria Carmona, ed.,\u00a0<em>Epistolario selecto de Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</em>\u00a0(M\u00e9xico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, 1989).</p> <p><strong>Israel Citkowitz\u00a0</strong>(Copland Collection; originals). Citkowitz was a slightly younger composer (1909-1974), gifted in song and chamber music, for whom Copland had high hopes. The online collection contains all Copland's letters to Citkowitz in the Copland Collection.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection). American patron of chamber music. She commissioned from Copland (and thus had dedicated to her) <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/q/#work0067\">Piano Quartet</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jacobo Ficher</strong>\u00a0(Ficher Collection). Argentinian composer. Copland's letters to him document his interest in South American music.</p> <p><strong>Irving and Verna Fine</strong>\u00a0(Irving Fine Collection). Irving Fine was a composer and younger colleague of Copland whose choral arrangements of several of Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0have given them a life as choral works. Copland shared houses with Irving and Verna Fine for several summers at Tanglewood. After Irving Fine's death in 1962 Copland continued to be supportive of Verna Fine, and his letters to her retain warmth and sparkle to the end of his letter-writing years. Copland dedicated \"Sleep Is Supposed to Be,\" one of the two central songs of his<em> </em><a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0074\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>, to Irving Fine. The Irving Fine Collection also contains letters from Copland to Verna Fine's mother, Florence Rudnick, in whose Boston apartment he sequestered himself to write\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/i/#work0065\"><em>In the Beginning</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky</strong>\u00a0(Koussevitzky Collection). Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony from 1924 to 1949, was the first performer to champion Copland's music in America and remained a supporter of Copland (and of many other American composers) until his death. Copland, in turn, was a major help to Koussevitzky from 1940 on in the running of the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood. Copland's letters to Koussevitzky's first wife, Natalie, are, for the most part, social; his letters to Koussevitzky's second wife, Olga (Olga Naumoff, Koussevitzky's secretary, until 1947), concern the running of Tanglewood. Copland's\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0025\">Third Symphony</a>\u00a0is dedicated \"To the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.\"</p> <p><strong>Minna Lederman</strong>\u00a0(<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives). Lederman was editor of the journal of the League of Composers,\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>, which was published from 1924 to 1946. Copland was a major contributor to the magazine and a trusted advisor to Lederman.</p> <p><strong>Marcelle de Manziarly</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). French composer, Boulanger student. Copland dedicated \"Heart, We Will Forget Him,\" the fifth of his<em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, to de Manziarly.</p>  <p><strong>Olga Naumoff:</strong>\u00a0see Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky.</p> <p><strong>Walter Piston</strong>\u00a0(Piston Collection). American composer. The body of Piston's correspondence is in the Boston Public Library; the one letter in this online collection represents the small but important collection of letters to Piston from the years 1931-55 that is in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.</p> <p><strong>Florence Rudnick:</strong>\u00a0see Irving and Verna Fine.</p> <p><strong>Roger Sessions</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies) American composer; co-producer with Copland of the Copland-Sessions Concerts during the years 1928-31.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Slonimsky</strong>\u00a0(Slonimsky Collection; some early letters in the Koussevitzky Collection). Musical polymath. During most of the period in which Copland corresponded with him he was musical secretary to Koussevitzky; the jokey letters to the incorrigibly humorous Slonimsky serve to balance Copland's oh-so-serious letters to Koussevitzky himself.</p> <p><strong>Harold Spivacke</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection; Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music). Chief of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, 1937-1972. Spivacke's tact and unflappable serenity kept the commissioning of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0on course.</p> <p><strong>William Strickland</strong>\u00a0(Strickland Collection). American conductor. Some of the letters in this online collection are concerned with Strickland's editorship of the H. W. Gray organ series, for which Copland wrote his\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/e/#work0097\"><em>Episode</em></a>.</p> <p>\"The man is in the letters.\" It might then seem as though a collection of more than eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland would give a complete portrait of the man and the composer. However, users of this online collection should remember that these letters represent only the holdings of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. At least equally important are Copland's letters to Virgil Thomson (at Yale University); Claire Reis and William Schuman (at the New York Public Library); Howard Clurman, David Diamond, and Walter Piston (at the Boston Public Library); and several others. To each of his correspondents Copland shows a slightly different aspect of his personality, so the letters in this online collection provide a detailed self-portrait if not a complete one.</p>  <h2>The Copland Sketches</h2>  <p>This online collection contains approximately 2500 pages of Aaron Copland's sketches\u00a0for his music, representing thirty-one of his works\u2014thirty-three if one includes the\u00a0<em>Sextet</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>Orchestra Variations</em>, covered by the sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>\u00a0respectively. Representing many of Copland's best-known and most significant works, the sketches are often revelatory. Except for some miscellaneous accompanying material, the online collection includes all the sketches for the works in the online collection.</p> <p>There are works for which the Library of Congress's archival Copland Collection contains no sketches. These include some of the early works and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>. Those who are interested in finding out whether the Library has sketches for a particular work not represented in the online collection, or curious about whether one of the works included has any material not presented online, should consult the Copland Collection Finding Aid.</p> <p>Within the sections of the online collection, the sketches are presented as much as possible in the order in which they were received from Aaron Copland or his estate. They have been much used by scholars, and they represent Copland's not always systematic use of music-paper. Some sets of sketches have been numbered by stamp at their top left- or right-hand corner; this numeration was done by the Library of Congress when the sketches were filmed in the mid-1970s and do not represent Copland's numbering. When two separate sets of sketches exist for a single work, they are presented here as two separate items. (Note: The page numbers of some of these sketches may not appear in numerical order online. However, they are presented here in exactly the order that Copland produced them.)</p> <p>The sketches reveal to scholars the history of Copland's work on the compositions, but they can also mean something to the general reader. The sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0022?sp=1\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>\u00a0show Copland searching for titles to do justice to three of his most characteristic works; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0032?sp=1\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>\u00a0show him deciding what poems to include in the cycle; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0015?sp=1\"><em>Billy the Kid</em></a> show that the opening music was first intended to be the start of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0014?sp=1\"><em>Music for Radio</em></a>\u2014 which now begins with much more complex music.</p>  <h2>The Copland Photographs</h2>  <p>The photographic materials in the Library of Congress's\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>number more than twelve thousand items spanning the years 1889 to 1985 and include both black and white and color prints, contact sheets, 35-mm negatives, color slides, and photograph albums. A substantial number of photographs were taken by Copland's lifelong friend, the professional photographer Victor Kraft. Widely known photographers whose work can be found in the collection include Carl Van Vechten, Irving Penn, Gordon Parks, and Margaret Bourke-White. The subject material comprises an inclusive chronology of Copland's life and includes Copland's family; Copland himself throughout his life; friends; acquaintances; fellow composers and other people with whom he worked; places where he studied, composed, or visited; and special events.</p> <p>From this vast collection, 111 photographs have been initially selected for the online collection. The digitized images fall into five broad categories: Family ; Copland Alone; Copland's Music; Copland with Other Composers and People; and Places and Events. Photographs that cannot be dated precisely or approximately have been given the designation of \"middle\" or \"late.\"</p> <h2>Family</h2> <p>Of the seven family photographs, one is a formal sitting of Copland's paternal grandparents and three of their children, while another shows Copland's parents, Sarah and Harris Copland, in front of their department store in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922. The other five capture Copland with other family members.</p> <h2>Aaron Copland Alone</h2> <p>The twenty-four photographs of Copland alone show him both formally and informally and at a range of ages from six to his seventies. Several feature Copland at his home, Rock Hill, in Courtlandt near Peekskill, New York.</p>  <h2>Copland's Music</h2> <p>Twenty-one photographs capture performances or rehearsals of thirteen musical works. The orchestral works represented are the\u00a0<em>Piano Concerto</em>, in a photograph showing Copland at the piano and Andr\u00e9 Previn conducting; the\u00a0<em>Clarinet Concerto</em>with Benny Goodman as the soloist and Copland conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>\u00a0in two rehearsal photographs, one in color with Marian Anderson as the speaker and the other with Adlai Stevenson, both with Copland conducting. The two ballets represented are scenes from the premiere performance of\u00a0<em>Appalachian Spring</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress and\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em>, which was premiered by Lincoln Kirstein and the Ballet Caravan.</p> <p>Three of the eight films for which Copland wrote music scores are illustrated in this online collection. Production stills represent\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>. There are also two informal photographs of the making of\u00a0<em>The Red Pon</em>y depicting Copland with the pony and the young boy and one studio-recording shot of Copland conducting the music for\u00a0<em>Something Wild</em>\u00a0that shows the star, Carroll Baker, in a television monitor.</p> <p>One chamber work is represented in a rehearsal of the\u00a0<em>Nonet</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress with Copland conducting. Two photographs depict William Warfield with Copland during rehearsals of\u00a0<em>Old American Songs</em>. There is also a stage shot of the opera\u00a0<em>The Tender Land</em>.</p>  <h2>Copland with Other Composers and People</h2> <p>Numerous photographs capture Copland with fellow composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Norman Dello Joio, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Irving Fine, Arthur Berger, Douglas Moore, Benjamin Britten, Darius Milhaud, Philip Ramey, Walter Piston, Domingo Santa Cruz, Virgil Thomson, Roger Sessions, and Igor Stravinsky. He is also shown with such notable cultural figures and musicians as Artur Rubinstein, Claire Booth Luce, Clarence Adler, Nadia Boulanger, Victor Kraft, Vivian Perlis, Claire Reis, Jack Garfein, Thorton Wilder, Serge Koussevitzky, Agnes de Mille, and Oliver Smith.</p> <h2>Places and Events</h2> <p>The group of photographs entitled Places and Events shows Coplan Fontainebleau and Aldeburgh; in Paris, Germany, England, Peru, Israel, and Mexico; at Nadia Boulanger's studio with other students; at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and Tanglewood; and at the University of Kansas, Brown University and Columbia University.</p> <h2>The Copland Writings</h2>  <p>Aaron Copland was best known first as a composer and later, in the 1960s and '70s, as a conductor. His name is less frequently associated with literary endeavors. The\u00a0Writings\u00a0portion of the\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0suggests that in this respect his reputation should perhaps be revised: it includes a vast array of articles, lectures, speeches, book drafts, and radio and television commentaries that span the years 1925 to 1988. The long stream of Copland's literary efforts began with an article written for publication in 1925, shortly after his return to the United States from three years in Paris, and continued into the late 1970s and early 1980s. He displayed the same technique in his writings that he did in his music: that is, a frequent self-borrowing in which he used the same material in different media.</p> <p>The writings selected for this online collection comprise eighty-six items. The selections represent unpublished drafts of material for articles, lectures, and speeches. Some selections display Copland's literary processes in thoughtful revisions, word changes, rearranging, and other editorial techniques. He usually began with handwritten notes or drafts and proceeded through several typewritten drafts before creating a final unmarked typewritten version. (Example: \"A Visit to Snape,\"\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0026?sp=1\">Version 2</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0027?sp=1\">Version 3</a>\u00a0) Not every literary work in the Aaron Copland Collection illustrates this transformation, however. The lectures and speeches display another aspect of Copland's literary endeavors: the fact that he underscored almost every word in red or blue pencil. Because he probably made these markings to help him deliver his speeches, they recapture something of the sound as well as the thought of his vocal presentations. They also add a colorful element to the handwritten and typed drafts.</p> <p>Like many conductors, Copland used a similar device in his conducting scores, where red and blue pencil markings draw the eye to changes in time signature, dynamics, and the entrances of instruments. [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0092?sp=1\">\"Talk on Leonard Bernstein\"</a>]</p> <p>Whatever their intended uses, the online examples of Copland's unpublished writings can be grouped into four categories: autobiographical, about Copland's music, about other composers, and about other people.</p> <p>The two autobiographical titles contrast the esoteric concerns of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0005?sp=1\">\"Music and the Human Spirit\"</a>, in which Copland addresses \"the creation of an art music\" as one of \"humanity's truly unique achievements,\" with the practicality of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0003?sp=1\">\"The Composer as Conductor\"</a>\u00a0in which he recalls that \"Some twenty years ago, during the course of a memorable evening at the Stravinskys' home in Los Angeles, the venerable maestro turned to me and said in no uncertain terms: 'My dear, you should conduct your own music. All composers should conduct their own music!'\"</p> <p>The writings about Copland's music highlight eleven of Copland's compositions in five different media. Writings on two ballets describe his collaboration with Martha Graham (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0007?sp=1\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>) and his work with Lincoln Kirstein on the story for<em>Billy the Kid</em>, (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0008?sp=1\">\"About\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em></a>\" and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0018?sp=1\">\"Notes on a Cowboy Ballet\"</a>). Copland discusses the creation of his three major solo piano works,\u00a0<em>Piano Fantasy</em>\", \"<em>Piano Sonata</em>,\" and \"<em>Piano Variations</em>,\" in two different lectures under the title <a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0011?sp=1\">Compositional Phases [on My Three Piano Works]</a>.\" An article about the 1925 orchestral work\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0017?sp=1\"><em>Music for the Theatre</em></a>\u00a0summarizes the reaction of audiences, musicians, and reviewers in the United States and Europe, including the performance by the New York Symphony Orchestra in which its conductor, Dr. Walter Damrosch, had \"revenge in the end.\" Copland wrote\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0028?sp=1\">A Visit to Snape</a>\u00a0for a tribute to Benjamin Britten on his fiftieth birthday; in it, he extols the \"kind of composer rapport\" between them and the \"exchange of musical impressions\" between his own \"The Second Hurricane\" and Britten's Piano Concerto No. 1.</p> <p>As the composer of several film scores, Copland was frequently asked to lecture or write about composing for the movies. In his discussions on the subject, Copland speaks not only about his experiences and the scores he wrote, but about other film composers and working in Hollywood. In\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0012?sp=1\">\"Film Music\"</a>, a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art Film Library in 1940, Copland briefly describes Hollywood and the mysterious nature of film music. He talks about the music he wrote for the film\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0049\"><em>Of Mice and Men</em></a>; four film composers, Eric Korngold, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, and Herbert Stoddard; and some of their film scores. By the time he gave the lecture\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0015?sp=1\">\"Film Talk\"</a>\u00a0at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, Copland's credentials as a film composer included six feature films and two documentaries. On that occasion, excerpts from three features (<em>Something Wild</em>,\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>, and\u00a0<em>The Heiress</em>) and one documentary (<em>The City</em>) were screened as he commented on how music may help a film and how one sets music to a film.</p> <p>The largest category of writings in this online collection centers on Copland's views about other composers. In these works, Copland speaks not only about his American contemporaries but about Mozart\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0037?sp=1\">(\"At the Thought of Mozart\")</a>, Berlioz\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0039?sp=1\">(\"Berlioz - from the Composer's Standpoint\")</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0040?sp=1\">Pierre Boulez</a>;<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0049?sp=1\">Composers in Russia</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0051?sp=1\">Composers of South America</a>; Michael Tippett (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0055?sp=1\">\"Cousin Michael\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0057?sp=1\">Darius Milhaud</a>, Dmitri Shostakovitch (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0059?sp=1\">\"Dmitri Shostakovitch and the New Simplicity\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0060?sp=1\">Gabriel Faur\u00e9</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0062?sp=1\">Franz Liszt</a>, Gustav Mahler\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0077?sp=1\">(\"Mahler (XX Cent[ury]\")</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0091?sp=1\">Igor Stravinsky</a>, Serge Prokofieff [Sergey Prokofiev]\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0087?sp=1\">(\"On the Occasion of the 70th Birthday of Serge Prokofieff\")\u00a0</a>, Benjamin Britten\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0090?sp=1\">(\"Special Fondness for B.B. [Benjamin Britten]\")\u00a0</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0097?sp=1\">Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly</a>. Copland was concerned above all with educating others about composers and their music, and in these writings he sometimes presents his personal viewpoints and reflections. At the National Arts Club in 1968, for example, he spoke about Leonard Bernstein's gifts and how it was \"impossible to imagine the American musical scene in the last quarter century without him.\" [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0075?sp=1\">\"LB\"</a>]</p> <p>As Copland lived on through the century, he was asked to write celebratory epistles or obituaries about many of his contemporaries, whether they were composers or others who had influenced his life. These writings about other people offer Copland's portraits of his Parisian teacher, Nadia Boulanger\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0099?sp=1\">(\"Intro[duction] of N[adia] Boulanger as Teacher\")</a>; his early theory teacher, Rubin Goldmark<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0112?sp=1\">(\"Rubin Goldmark: A Tribute\")</a>; his publisher, Ralph Hawkes\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0111?sp=1\">(\"Ralph Hawkes: In Memoriam\")\u00a0</a>; his friend and colleague at the League of Composers,<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0109?sp=1\">Claire Reis</a>; and his long-time supporter, the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0114?sp=1\">(\"Serge Koussevitzky - The 100th Anniversary [unpublished writings]\")</a>. \"It is almost forty years since first I rang the bell at Nadia Boulanger's Paris apartment . . . \" begins the 1960 tribute to his teacher,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0102?sp=1\">(\"The Teacher: Nadia Boulanger\")</a>, the person who was most influential in molding and forming the composer Aaron Copland.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:06:10.084Z", "date": "1841", "shelf_id": "~/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "other_title": ["Copland collection,"], "count": 982, "dates": ["1841-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2003561015"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/copland/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2003561015", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2003561015/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/collmus.mu000006", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006.3/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006.3", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmus.mu000006/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006/"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "original_format": ["collection", "book"], "id": "http://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "partof": ["african and middle eastern division", "digital collections", "abdul-hamid ii collection of books and serials gifted to the library of congress"], "subject": ["world cultures & history"], "index": 12, "group": ["collections-portal"], "title": "Abdul-Hamid II Collection of Books and Serials Gifted to the Library of Congress", "digitized": true, "description": ["<p>In 1884 Sultan Abdul-Hamid II gifted the Library of Congress with a collection of Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Arabic works that he had richly embossed with this inscription in English, French and Ottoman: \"Gift made by H.I.

When the young boy fainted, he was taken to the guard house where two other boys his age observed all the excitement and reported back to their father, the Sultan, what they had seen.\u00a0Their father dispatched his emissaries to Hewitt's hotel to inquire about his son's well-being and to request that he and his son visit the palace the next day.</p>  <p>During the visit, the Sultan noticed Hewitt's indelible pencil and special cigarettes which resulted in a gift shipment to Abdul-Hamid II when Hewitt returned home. Shortly thereafter, Hewitt received a notice that he owed $1,480 in customs duties on a shipment of Ottoman books. He wrote back to the Sultan that he didn't deserve such an honor and that the Sultan should give the books to the Library of Congress. The Sultan agreed and had the special collection prepared for the Library and invited Hewitt to keep the first set for himself. Hewitt paid the duty and this set is now in the New York University Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.</p>  <p>By 1984, it was determined that the Abdul-Hamid II gift books had become very brittle with paper that was too fragile to serve to researchers and a decision was made to microfilm the collection. 309 books and serials have been scanned from this microfilm for this digital collection. There are 26 existent Abdul-Hamid II books which also have been digitized.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "shelf_id": "~/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "other_title": [], "count": 323, "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/hamidbooks/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.ahii"], "call_number": ["Guide Record"], "contributors": ["Abd\u00fclhamid II, Sultan of the Turks, 1842-1918 donor.", "Abdullah fr\u00e8res, photographer.", "Sebah & Joaillier, photographer."], "language": ["ota"], "title": "Abdul-Hamid II collection of photographs of the Ottoman Empire", "notes": ["Albums generally arranged by subject.

The Lincoln Papers came to the Library of  Congress from Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln (1843-1926), who  arranged for their organization and care shortly after his father was  assassinated on April 14, 1865. At that time, Robert Todd Lincoln had the  Lincoln Papers removed to Illinois, where they were first organized under the  direction of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln's  longtime associate. Later, Lincoln&rsquo;s presidential secretaries, John G. Nicolay  and John Hay, assisted in the project. In 1874, most of the Lincoln Papers  returned to Washington, D.C., and Nicolay and Hay used them in the research and  writing of their ten-volume biography, <em>Abraham Lincoln: A History</em> (New  York, 1890). Robert Todd Lincoln deposited the Lincoln Papers with the Library  of Congress in 1919, and deeded them to the Library on January 23, 1923. The  deed stipulated that the Lincoln Papers remain sealed until twenty-one years  after Robert Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s death. On July 26, 1947, the Lincoln Papers were  officially opened to the public. </p>  <p>The most complete account  of the early history of the Abraham Lincoln Papers appears in volume 1 of David  C. Mearns, <em>The Lincoln Papers</em> (Garden City, N.Y., 1948), 3-136. An  article by the same author which appeared in the December 1947 issue of the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/alajournals/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Abraham Lincoln Quarterly</em> <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> contains the substance of the story.

A <a href=\"/resource/mal.4167500/\">list of the &ldquo;Carpet Bag Documents&rdquo;</a> created  in 1874 by Lincoln&rsquo;s secretary John G. Nicolay is available in this series.</p>  <p><a href=\"/collections/abraham-lincoln-papers/?fa=partof%3Aabraham+lincoln+papers+at+the+library+of+congress%3A+series+2.+general+correspondence.+1858-1864\">Series  2, Additional Correspondence, 1858-1865</a> <br>   Comprised of correspondence retained by  Lincoln&rsquo;s secretary John G. Nicolay, which remained with the Nicolay Papers  (received by the Library in 1947) until August 1959, when the letters were  removed and reincorporated with the Lincoln Papers.</p>  <p><a href=\"/collections/abraham-lincoln-papers/?fa=partof%3Aabraham+lincoln+papers+at+the+library+of+congress%3A+series+3.+general+correspondence.+1837-1897\">Series  3, Miscellaneous, 1837-1897</a> <br>   Includes single or small numbers of manuscripts  which have been acquired by the Library of Congress from a variety of sources.</p>  <p><a href=\"/collections/abraham-lincoln-papers/?fa=partof%3Aabraham+lincoln+papers+at+the+library+of+congress%3A+series+4.+addenda%2C+1774-1948\">Series  4, Addenda, 1774-1948</a> <br>   The addenda to the Abraham Lincoln Papers  consists mostly of reproductions of government and military documents made from  originals in the holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration,  1774-1887. Reproductions of documents held by the National Archives are not  represented on this online collection, nor are published materials. Original  items contained in Series 4 are included in this online collection and include  letters written by Abraham Lincoln, an autobiographical sketch written in 1859  at the request of Jesse W. Fell, mourning cards, political ephemera, a pen  purportedly used by Abraham Lincoln, and papers omitted as not being integral  to the collection when it was microfilmed and indexed in 1960. Please consult  the collection finding aid (<a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009304.3\">PDF</a> and <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms009304\">HTML</a>) for more detailed information about the  contents of Series 4. </p>  <p>Oversize, 1776-1865<br>   Includes original correspondence and facsimile  reproductions, certificates, pardons, a petition, a poem, pen, and printed  matter. Images of all oversize materials in Series 1-3 and original materials  in Series 4 are included in the online presentation and appear with the series  from which they were withdrawn when rehoused as part of an oversize series. Oversize  facsimiles and reproductions were not included in the online presentation.</p>  <p><strong>Transcriptions Included on  this Website</strong></p>  <p> Transcriptions are included for about 10,000  items (about half of the online collection). The Lincoln Studies Center at Knox  College in Galesburg, Illinois performed the editorial work, which included  selecting the documents to be transcribed. &nbsp;Their choices were based on  either a document's historical importance or as representative of the  president&rsquo;s unsolicited incoming mail. Annotated transcriptions were provided  for all of the documents in Lincoln's own hand and for secretarial copies of  Lincoln documents located in Series 1-3 of the Lincoln Papers.&nbsp;Many of the  other transcriptions were also annotated to aid users in identifying the people  involved and in better understanding the content and historical contexts.&nbsp;Annotations for Lincoln's  autograph documents usually include a headnote providing historical and  documentary context, as well as annotations on the content of the document.  Annotations for incoming correspondence typically identify persons and  organizations writing to Lincoln or referred to in the documents, explain terms  and events, and provide brief historical context. Together, these fully  searchable transcriptions and annotations dramatically extend access to the  Abraham Lincoln Papers and enhance their teaching and research value.

When he returned nearly three months later, having driven thousands of miles on barely paved roads, it was with a cache of 250 instantaneous discs and eight reels of film documenting the incredible range of ethnic diversity and expressive traditions primarily in Michigan. </p> <p>The Alan Lomax collection of Michigan and Wisconsin recordings (AFC 1939/007) documents Irish, Italian, Finnish, Serbian, Lithuanian, Polish, German, Croatian, French Canadian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Swedish songs and stories, as well as occupational folklife among loggers and lake sailors in Michigan and Wisconsin. Lomax&rsquo;s itinerary took him from Detroit through the Saginaw River valley to the northern counties of the Lower Peninsula, including Beaver Island. Crossing the Straits of Mackinac, he collected across the Upper Peninsula to the far northern Calumet area and then along the Lake Superior coast to easternmost Wisconsin.</p> <p>The recordings in this collection and related collections in the American Folklife Center provide early documentation of the Upper Midwest&rsquo;s rich culture. This collection is the result of a conscious decision by the Library of Congress to undertake regional documentation of American folk song in recognition that the voices of ordinary people have a place at the national library.

Because the Bell Papers are so numerous and inclusive, navigation through them can be difficult. Therefore, one of the main objectives of the selection process was to identify those materials which mainly focused on Alexander Graham Bell and his work, varied interests, and achievements. Another important goal was to choose those materials that best offered a well-rounded portrayal of Bell--not only as an inventor and scientist but also as a teacher, husband, and father. Items were also selected if they appeared historically useful or significant, such as correspondence pertaining to the development of the Bell Telephone Company or Mabel Hubbard Bell's written accounts of her experiences growing up deaf. </p> <p> The Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers were donated to the Library of Congress by his heirs in 1975. Prior to this donation, the papers were on deposit at the National Geographic Society, where they were organized and maintained. In order to make the collection easier to use, the Society prepared typed transcripts of a large portion of the handwritten letters. These valuable transcriptions were retained and have been reproduced here along with the original letters. Occasionally the original is missing and only the transcription is still available. One should keep in mind that these transcripts are now decades old and may occasionally be difficult to read due to faded, bleeding, or blurred text.</p> <p> The Bell Papers contain a considerable amount of correspondence, much of which reflects the writing practices of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As letter writing becomes less popular, some awareness of common, older practices may be helpful. Since the typical handwritten letter is essentially a single sheet of paper folded in half (and usually written on all four sides), the digital scan and display of each unfolded sheet usually show an image of pages four and one (or back and front), and another of pages three and two (or the inside two pages). <a href=\"/resource/magbell.03500220/seq-1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Today's readers also should be aware of such papers-saving tactics as writing-over, or text over text. In such cases, the writer would literally write over a completed page, making the added words somewhat readable by turning the page sideways and writing horizontally against what were now vertical written lines. <a href=\"/resource/magbell.02800127/?sp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Surprisingly, if the writer was careful and lengthened his or her hand while also trying to write only in the spaces between lines, such letters can be read with little difficulty. </p>  <div class=\"i_aligncenter i_caption\"      style=\"width: 444px;\"> <a href=\"/item/magbellbib000925\"><img

It ends with his last letters to his wife before his death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July 1804.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+speeches+and+writings+file%2C+1778-1804\">Speeches and Writings, 1778-1804</a> (Reels 21-23)</strong><br>    Drafts, copies, and notes of reports; political essays, speeches, New York legislative acts, and more composed by Hamilton from the American Revolution until his death. Of note is an outline of the speech he delivered at the Constitutional Convention on June 18, 1787; his notes on debates and speeches at New York's ratifying convention, June 1788; drafts of the four major economic reports he wrote as treasury secretary (on public credit, creation of a national bank, establishment of a mint, and development of manufacturing); drafts of the speeches he wrote for George Washington, including Washington's 1796 farewell address; notes he took at New York's constitutional convention of 1787; and drafts of some of his political essays.

Most of these are ordered alphabetically by case. Some of the landmark cases included in his papers are Rutgers v. Waddington, People v. Croswell, Hylton v. United States, and cases forming the LeGuen v. Gouverneur and Kemble litigation.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+financial+papers%2C+1782-1804\">Financial Papers, 1782-1804</a> (Reel 29)</strong><br>    The financial papers, which form the smallest segment of the collection, consist of two volumes of accounts relating to Hamilton's law practice, and a folder of miscellaneous receipts. Some of the receipts are for money Hamilton paid engineer William Pearce on behalf of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures to provide machinery for manufacturing cotton, 1791-1792.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+family+papers%2C+1737-1917\">Family Papers, 1737-1917</a></strong>  (Reels 29-31)</strong><br>    Letters and other documents of members of the Hamilton, Schuyler, and related families, but not including Alexander Hamilton himself.

Through the marriage of Philip Hamilton to Rebecca McLane, several McLane family letters were incorporated into the papers. Most of the nonfamily correspondence of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton relates to the management of her properties and to arrangements for the publication of Hamilton's papers. Scattered letters addressed to Alexander Hamilton (Alexander and Elizabeth's grandson), James A. Hamilton, John Church Hamilton, and to members of the McLane family are also included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+miscellany%2C+1711-1820\">Miscellany, 1711-1820</a> (Reels 31-34)</strong><br>    A mixture of original and copied documents.

Originals include a letter from Nicholas Everton to Hamilton concerning  legal matters and a Treasury Department circular. Photocopied material includes  letters by Hamilton, miscellaneous images, and a page from a church register  recording his marriage.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+2017+addition%2C+1790-1804\">  2017 Addition, 1790-1804</a></a></strong> <br>       This series consists of fifty-five letters, originally owned by Hamilton  descendants, purchased by the Library of Congress at Sotheby's in January 2017.  Fifty-one of these, 1790-1804, are from Philip Schuyler (1733-1804) to his  son-in-law Alexander Hamilton and daughter Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. The  remainder consists of two additional family letters, a letter from Charles  Pierre L'Enfant to Hamilton, July 14, 1801, concerning L'Enfant's renovation of  City Hall in New York into Federal Hall, and a fragment of a will in Hamilton's  hand, [July 1795].     </li>   <li><strong>Oversize</strong><br>    Correspondence, reports, annotated drafts of the Constitution, writings, deeds, agreements, contracts, financial papers, certificates, and printed matter.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:04:55.870Z", "date": "2005", "shelf_id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "other_title": [], "count": 60, "dates": ["2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2006570208"], "language": ["english"], "url": "//international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "items": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/kskm/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2006570208", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2006570208/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/collrbc.rb000009", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collrbc.rb000009/"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "original_format": ["collection", "sound recording"], "id": "http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/afccards/afccards-home.html", "partof": ["digital collections", "american folklife center", "traditional music and spoken word"], "subject": ["local history & folklife", "performing arts"], "index": 3, "group": ["collections-portal"], "title": "Traditional Music and Spoken Word", "location": ["united states"], "_partof": "traditional music and spoken word", "digitized": true, "description": ["<p>The audio recordings represented in the catalog were recorded between 1897 and 1962.

There are hundreds of well-known and lesser-known treasures by other notable collectors including Herbert Halpert, Zora Neale Hurston, Henrietta Yurchenco, Vance Randolph, and Helen Creighton, among many others.

The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog.

Conservation Movement, 1850-1920</em> documents  the historical formation and cultural foundations of the movement to  conserve and protect America's natural heritage, through books,  pamphlets, government documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and  motion picture footage drawn from the collections of the Library of  Congress.</p> <p> The collection consists of 62 books and pamphlets, 140 Federal statutes  and Congressional resolutions, 34 additional legislative documents,  excerpts from the <em>Congressional Globe</em> and the <em>Congressional Record</em>, 360 Presidential proclamations, 170 prints and photographs, 2 historic manuscripts, and 2 motion pictures. </p> <h2>Preface: The Early Conservation Movement in Context</h2> <p>Concern for the relationship between humans and the natural world has  been a definitive element in nearly all cultures.  In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:05:19.879Z", "date": "1850", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "other_title": [], "count": 744, "dates": ["1850-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1851-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1852-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1853-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1854-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1855-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1856-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1857-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1858-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1859-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1860-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1861-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1862-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1863-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1864-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1865-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1866-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1867-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1868-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1869-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1870-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1871-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1872-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1873-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1874-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1875-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1876-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1877-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1878-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1879-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1880-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1881-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1882-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1883-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1884-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1885-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1886-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1887-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1888-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1889-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1891-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1892-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1893-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1894-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1895-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1896-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/conserve/"]}, {"item": {"digital_id": ["http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3"], "medium": ["25,000 items.", "95 containers plus 1 oversize.", "38 linear feet."], "repository": ["Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home"], "contributors": ["Arendt, Hannah, 1906-1975.", "Bl\u00fccher, Heinrich, 1899-1970."], "title": "Hannah Arendt papers,", "notes": ["Arranged in ten series.

The Hannah Arendt Papers (The Library of Congress Manuscript Division). </figcaption> </figure> <p>The Library of Congress received the Arendt Papers as a gift and bequest from   Hannah Arendt in various installments from 1965 to 2000. Small additions were   made by Klaus Loewald in 1981 and Roger Errera in 1994. </p> <p>The papers span the years 1898 to 1977, with the bulk of the material   beginning in 1948, three years before Arendt\u2019s naturalization as an American   citizen. The collection is organized in the following series: Family Papers,   Correspondence, Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and Writings File,   Clippings, Addition I, Addition II, and Addition III. Rich in manuscripts and   correspondence for Arendt's productive years as a writer and lecturer after   World War II, the papers are sparse before the mid-1940s because of Arendt's   forced departure from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her escape from occupied France   in 1941. Documentation for the first part of her life includes a few notebooks   and writings; several official and private records relating mainly to her   divorce, family history, and emigration; and a small group of personal   correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, some of whose letters   and unpublished writings can be found in the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/articles-and-essays/family-papers/\">Family Papers</a> series. Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Bl\u00fccher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H. Auden. Photographed by Arendt in her New York City   apartment, 1967.

The material traces Arendt's intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt's friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt's best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt's conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader's trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial's   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt's role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant's Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt's students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt's doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt's two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>.

A small group of lectures is also contained in   this addition. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder08.html\">Addition II</A> includes correspondence from Arendt to Heinrich Bl\u00fccher and a notebook kept by   Arendt's mother recording Arendt's development as a child. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder09.html\">Addition III</A> contains   additional correspondence and notes by Arendt.</p> <p>In addition to the correspondents noted above, the Arendt Papers include   letters to and from Hanan J. Ayalti (pen name of Hanan Klenbort), Walter   Benjamin, Rosalie Littell Colie, Robert and Elke Gilbert, J. Glenn Gray,   Waldemar Gurian, Rolf Hochhuth, Hans Jonas, Lotte Kohler, Judah Leon Magnes,   Hans Joachim Morgenthau, Ruth H. Rosenau, Gershom Gerhard Scholem, Paul Tillich,   Eric Voegelin, Ernst Vollrath, Anne Weil, and Helen and Kurt Wolff.</p> <p>Lotte Kohler's <em>Hannah Arendt/Heinrich Bl\u00fccher: Briefe 1936-1968</em> (M\u00fcnchen: Piper, 1996) was consulted during the arrangement of the   correspondence between Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher in the Family Papers series.   An English version of Kohler's work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000. The   photographs have been transferred to the Library's Prints and Photographs   Division where they are identified as a part of these papers. These are not   included in the online collection.</p> <p>For reference inquiries, please contact the Library of Congress <a href=\"//lcweb.loc.gov/rr/mss/\">Manuscript Reading Room</a>.</p> <h2 name=\"dgc\">The Digital Collection</h2> <p>In December 1998, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded the Library of   Congress a grant to support a two-year project to digitize the Hannah Arendt   Papers. The staff of the Manuscript Division at the Library administered the   project, with assistance from the National Digital Library Program (NDLP) and in   cooperation with the New School University in New York City. </p> <p>The digital version of the papers is being made available in two ways. The   collection is available in its entirety onsite at the Library of Congress and   two other research institutions. In addition, major portions of the collection   are available to the public on the Internet.</p> <h2 name=\"cdc\">Onsite Access to the Complete Digital Collection</h2> <p>The complete version of the digitized Arendt Papers (approximately 25,000   items; about 75,000 images) is available to researchers at three locations: the   reading room of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress, the New   School University\u2019s Hannah Arendt Center at the Fogelman Library, and the Hannah   Arendt Center at the University of Oldenburg, Germany.

In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:04:55.870Z", "date": "1996", "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "other_title": ["Vaudeville and popular entertainment, 1870-1920"], "count": 726, "dates": ["1870-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1871-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1872-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1873-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1874-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1875-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1876-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1877-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1878-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1879-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1880-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1881-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1882-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1883-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1884-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1885-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1886-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1887-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1888-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1889-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1891-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1892-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1893-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1894-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1895-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1896-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["96802670"], "language": ["english"], "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/var/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/varst/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-variety-stage/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/vaudeville/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/96802670", "http://www.loc.gov/item/96802670/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000048", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000048/"]}, {"number_oclc": ["86114510"], "item": {"call_number": ["Z6951", "AI3"], "language": ["eng"], "contributors": ["Library of Congress.", "National Endowment for the Humanities.", "National Digital Newspaper Program (U.S.)"], "format": ["text"], "notes": ["Began in 2006.", "Title from title screen (viewed July 7, 2009).", "\"Chronicling America is sponsored jointly by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)\"--Title screen."], "title": "Chronicling America : historic American newspapers.", "summary": ["This database allows you to search and view public domain newspaper pages (1690-1963) and find information about American newspapers published between 1690-present.

This program funded state-level projects to locate, describe (catalog), and selectively preserve (via treatment and microfilm) historic newspaper collections in that state, published from 1690 to the present. Under this program, each institution created machine-readable cataloging (MARC) via the Cooperative ONline SERials Program (CONSER) for its state collections, contributing bibliographic descriptions and library holdings information to the Newspaper Union List, hosted by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).

These items date from 1899 to 1981, with most from the 1920s through the 1950s, and were selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and\u00a0photographs.</p> <p>Celebrating the centennial of the birth of the American composer Aaron Copland (1900-1990), the multi-format Aaron Copland Collection, from which the online collection derives, spans the years 1910 to 1990 and includes approximately 400,000 items documenting the multifaceted life of an extraordinary person who was composer, performer, teacher, writer, conductor, commentator, and administrator. It comprises both manuscript and printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries, writings, scrapbooks, programs, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, awards, books, sound recordings, and motion pictures.</p>  <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Aaron Copland devoted his life as a twentieth-century composer to fostering, developing, creating, and establishing distinctive \"American\" music. He became known as the \"Dean of American Music,\" a sobriquet with which he was uncomfortable. His name is synonymous with\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0\u2014the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize in Music\u2014and\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/f/#work0021\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>.</p> <p>Copland extensively documented the many facets of his life in music, and the<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress reflects the entire breadth of his endeavors. Beginning in the late 1950s and early &lsquo;60s, Copland periodically deposited his original music manuscripts at the Library of Congress and subsequently converted them to gifts. In the fall of 1989, he donated all his papers to the Library. The collection numbers approximately four hundred thousand items, dating from 1910 to 1990 with a few nineteenth-century photographs, and includes his music manuscripts, printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries and writings, photographic materials, awards, honorary degrees, programs, and other biographical materials. It is the primary resource for research on Aaron Copland and a major resource for the study of musical life in twentieth-century America generally, particularly from the 1920s to the 1960s.</p> <p>The online\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0comprises approximately one thousand items selected from Copland's\u00a0music sketches,\u00a0correspondence,\u00a0writings, and photographs. The items are represented in about five thousand digitized images, the earliest an 1899 photograph and the latest a 1986 letter. While the original collection contains almost all Copland's music manuscripts and printed scores, the online collection presents the original music sketches that Copland used in composing thirty-one works spanning the years 1924 to 1967 and covering every medium in which he composed: orchestral, ballet, opera, film, chamber, solo piano, and vocal music.</p> <p>The correspondence in the online collection comprises images of approximately eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Copland that have been selected from the Aaron Copland Collection and other collections in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0at the Library of Congress. Besides letters to his parents and other family members in the 1920s and 30s, the correspondence includes Copland's letters to his Parisian teacher Nadia Boulanger, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and others such as Nicolas Slonimsky, Roger Sessions, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Walter Piston, Leonard Bernstein, and Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>As an advocate and supporter of American music and American composers, Copland frequently wrote articles, presented lectures, and delivered speeches. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0presents eighty-six of Copland's previously unpublished drafts. These show the creative process through which he wrote about his own music, other composers and their music, and other people who played important roles in his musical life.</p> <p>Of the twelve thousand photographic materials in the Library's Aaron Copland Collection, 111 items have been chosen for online presentation. Many were created by Copland's friend Victor Kraft, a professional photographer. They include portraits of Aaron Copland at various ages and places, with family members, with other composers, and with other people associated with his career as a composer and conductor, as well as images from his worldwide travels.</p>  <h2>The Copland Letters</h2>  <p>\"The man is in the letters,\" said Vivian Perlis of Aaron Copland, whose autobiography she helped to write. The online\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\u00a0contains digitized images of over eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland covering the years from 1921 to 1986. Searchable texts of all published letters, postcards, and telegrams in the collection are also available.</p> <p>The letters reproduced in the collection represent, though they do not exhaust, the holdings of Copland's correspondence in the\u00a0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\u00a0of the Library of Congress. In general they constitute significant runs of letters to people important in Copland's life. (Problems of copyright and volume preclude making letters to Copland available online.) Every attempt has been made to include all the letters in the Music Division that Copland wrote to each correspondent represented, the one exception being the letters to Harold Spivacke, which constitute only a part of Copland's voluminous and largely business-related correspondence with the Music Division's former chief.</p> <p>These letters come from many collections in the Music Division. Besides material from the Aaron Copland Collection, they contain material from the Leonard Bernstein Collection, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Collection, the Jacobo Ficher Collection, the Irving Fine Collection, the Louis Kaufman Collection, the Serge Koussevitzky Collection, the\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives, the Walter Piston Collection, the Nicolas Slonimsky Collection, the William Strickland Collection, and the papers of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music.</p> <p>The letters Copland wrote that are in the Copland Collection proper came back to him in various ways. He inherited his letters to his parents after their deaths. In the 1970s, when he began to think of writing his autobiography, he asked several of his friends and colleagues to send him photocopies of his letters. Some replied with photocopies, some by returning the letters themselves. Some responded with many letters, some with just a few.</p> <p>Copland seldom made carbons copies of his outgoing correspondence. The few periods in his life for which the Copland Collection is rich in carbon copies are the brief intervals when he had a secretary: in 1943 while working on the film\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>; during his South American tour in 1947; in the fall of 1958 when he was staying in London and presumably was provided with a secretary by his publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Because they were obviously dictated to a secretary, these letters have the flavor of Copland's post-1940 correspondence but are not particularly trenchant, lacking the distinctive qualities that came forth when Copland himself sat down to write.</p>  <p>The following individuals are the major correspondents represented in the letters portion of this online collection. They are listed with the source collection for Copland's letters to them or, in the case of material in the Copland Collection itself, with an indication of whether the letters are originals or photocopies.</p> <p><strong>Arthur Berger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopy). The online collection contains a <a href=\"/resource/copland.corr0796?sp=1\">single letter</a>\u00a0to this writer of the first book-length study of Copland; it is perhaps the most evocative of Copland's letters describing his Mexican visits.</p> <p><strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong>\u00a0(Bernstein Collection). Copland's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the late 1930s and early 1940s,\u00a0Bernstein\u00a0became one of the leading champions and interpreters of Copland's music.</p> <p><strong>Nadia Boulanger</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Copland's principal teacher and mentor. His Nonet is dedicated to her.</p> <p><strong>Paul Bowles</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). Composer and novelist. The two letters in the Copland Collection seem to have been part of a voluminous and regular correspondence.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). English composer. The first set of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0was written for Britten and his collaborator Peter Pears. Britten's side of the correspondence is published in Donald Mitchell et al., eds.,\u00a0<em>Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, 1913-1976\u00a0</em>(2 vols., Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).</p> <p><strong>Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies). Mexican composer; one of Copland's principal composer friends. As a conductor, Ch\u00e1vez performed Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/s/#work0012\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0when American conductors had declared it unperformable. Ch\u00e1vez's side of the correspondence and slightly abridged versions of Copland's letters are published in Spanish translation in Gloria Carmona, ed.,\u00a0<em>Epistolario selecto de Carlos Ch\u00e1vez</em>\u00a0(M\u00e9xico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, 1989).</p> <p><strong>Israel Citkowitz\u00a0</strong>(Copland Collection; originals). Citkowitz was a slightly younger composer (1909-1974), gifted in song and chamber music, for whom Copland had high hopes. The online collection contains all Copland's letters to Citkowitz in the Copland Collection.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection). American patron of chamber music. She commissioned from Copland (and thus had dedicated to her) <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/q/#work0067\">Piano Quartet</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jacobo Ficher</strong>\u00a0(Ficher Collection). Argentinian composer. Copland's letters to him document his interest in South American music.</p> <p><strong>Irving and Verna Fine</strong>\u00a0(Irving Fine Collection). Irving Fine was a composer and younger colleague of Copland whose choral arrangements of several of Copland's <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\u00a0have given them a life as choral works. Copland shared houses with Irving and Verna Fine for several summers at Tanglewood. After Irving Fine's death in 1962 Copland continued to be supportive of Verna Fine, and his letters to her retain warmth and sparkle to the end of his letter-writing years. Copland dedicated \"Sleep Is Supposed to Be,\" one of the two central songs of his<em> </em><a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0074\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>, to Irving Fine. The Irving Fine Collection also contains letters from Copland to Verna Fine's mother, Florence Rudnick, in whose Boston apartment he sequestered himself to write\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/i/#work0065\"><em>In the Beginning</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky</strong>\u00a0(Koussevitzky Collection). Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony from 1924 to 1949, was the first performer to champion Copland's music in America and remained a supporter of Copland (and of many other American composers) until his death. Copland, in turn, was a major help to Koussevitzky from 1940 on in the running of the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood. Copland's letters to Koussevitzky's first wife, Natalie, are, for the most part, social; his letters to Koussevitzky's second wife, Olga (Olga Naumoff, Koussevitzky's secretary, until 1947), concern the running of Tanglewood. Copland's\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0025\">Third Symphony</a>\u00a0is dedicated \"To the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.\"</p> <p><strong>Minna Lederman</strong>\u00a0(<em>Modern Music</em>\u00a0Archives). Lederman was editor of the journal of the League of Composers,\u00a0<em>Modern Music</em>, which was published from 1924 to 1946. Copland was a major contributor to the magazine and a trusted advisor to Lederman.</p> <p><strong>Marcelle de Manziarly</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; originals). French composer, Boulanger student. Copland dedicated \"Heart, We Will Forget Him,\" the fifth of his<em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, to de Manziarly.</p>  <p><strong>Olga Naumoff:</strong>\u00a0see Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky.</p> <p><strong>Walter Piston</strong>\u00a0(Piston Collection). American composer. The body of Piston's correspondence is in the Boston Public Library; the one letter in this online collection represents the small but important collection of letters to Piston from the years 1931-55 that is in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.</p> <p><strong>Florence Rudnick:</strong>\u00a0see Irving and Verna Fine.</p> <p><strong>Roger Sessions</strong>\u00a0(Copland Collection; photocopies) American composer; co-producer with Copland of the Copland-Sessions Concerts during the years 1928-31.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Slonimsky</strong>\u00a0(Slonimsky Collection; some early letters in the Koussevitzky Collection). Musical polymath. During most of the period in which Copland corresponded with him he was musical secretary to Koussevitzky; the jokey letters to the incorrigibly humorous Slonimsky serve to balance Copland's oh-so-serious letters to Koussevitzky himself.</p> <p><strong>Harold Spivacke</strong>\u00a0(Coolidge Collection; Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music). Chief of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, 1937-1972. Spivacke's tact and unflappable serenity kept the commissioning of\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\u00a0on course.</p> <p><strong>William Strickland</strong>\u00a0(Strickland Collection). American conductor. Some of the letters in this online collection are concerned with Strickland's editorship of the H. W. Gray organ series, for which Copland wrote his\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/e/#work0097\"><em>Episode</em></a>.</p> <p>\"The man is in the letters.\" It might then seem as though a collection of more than eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland would give a complete portrait of the man and the composer. However, users of this online collection should remember that these letters represent only the holdings of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. At least equally important are Copland's letters to Virgil Thomson (at Yale University); Claire Reis and William Schuman (at the New York Public Library); Howard Clurman, David Diamond, and Walter Piston (at the Boston Public Library); and several others. To each of his correspondents Copland shows a slightly different aspect of his personality, so the letters in this online collection provide a detailed self-portrait if not a complete one.</p>  <h2>The Copland Sketches</h2>  <p>This online collection contains approximately 2500 pages of Aaron Copland's sketches\u00a0for his music, representing thirty-one of his works\u2014thirty-three if one includes the\u00a0<em>Sextet</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>Orchestra Variations</em>, covered by the sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>\u00a0respectively. Representing many of Copland's best-known and most significant works, the sketches are often revelatory. Except for some miscellaneous accompanying material, the online collection includes all the sketches for the works in the online collection.</p> <p>There are works for which the Library of Congress's archival Copland Collection contains no sketches. These include some of the early works and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>. Those who are interested in finding out whether the Library has sketches for a particular work not represented in the online collection, or curious about whether one of the works included has any material not presented online, should consult the Copland Collection Finding Aid.</p> <p>Within the sections of the online collection, the sketches are presented as much as possible in the order in which they were received from Aaron Copland or his estate. They have been much used by scholars, and they represent Copland's not always systematic use of music-paper. Some sets of sketches have been numbered by stamp at their top left- or right-hand corner; this numeration was done by the Library of Congress when the sketches were filmed in the mid-1970s and do not represent Copland's numbering. When two separate sets of sketches exist for a single work, they are presented here as two separate items. (Note: The page numbers of some of these sketches may not appear in numerical order online. However, they are presented here in exactly the order that Copland produced them.)</p> <p>The sketches reveal to scholars the history of Copland's work on the compositions, but they can also mean something to the general reader. The sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0022?sp=1\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>\u00a0show Copland searching for titles to do justice to three of his most characteristic works; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0032?sp=1\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>\u00a0show him deciding what poems to include in the cycle; the sketches for\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0015?sp=1\"><em>Billy the Kid</em></a> show that the opening music was first intended to be the start of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0014?sp=1\"><em>Music for Radio</em></a>\u2014 which now begins with much more complex music.</p>  <h2>The Copland Photographs</h2>  <p>The photographic materials in the Library of Congress's\u00a0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>number more than twelve thousand items spanning the years 1889 to 1985 and include both black and white and color prints, contact sheets, 35-mm negatives, color slides, and photograph albums. A substantial number of photographs were taken by Copland's lifelong friend, the professional photographer Victor Kraft. Widely known photographers whose work can be found in the collection include Carl Van Vechten, Irving Penn, Gordon Parks, and Margaret Bourke-White. The subject material comprises an inclusive chronology of Copland's life and includes Copland's family; Copland himself throughout his life; friends; acquaintances; fellow composers and other people with whom he worked; places where he studied, composed, or visited; and special events.</p> <p>From this vast collection, 111 photographs have been initially selected for the online collection. The digitized images fall into five broad categories: Family ; Copland Alone; Copland's Music; Copland with Other Composers and People; and Places and Events. Photographs that cannot be dated precisely or approximately have been given the designation of \"middle\" or \"late.\"</p> <h2>Family</h2> <p>Of the seven family photographs, one is a formal sitting of Copland's paternal grandparents and three of their children, while another shows Copland's parents, Sarah and Harris Copland, in front of their department store in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922. The other five capture Copland with other family members.</p> <h2>Aaron Copland Alone</h2> <p>The twenty-four photographs of Copland alone show him both formally and informally and at a range of ages from six to his seventies. Several feature Copland at his home, Rock Hill, in Courtlandt near Peekskill, New York.</p>  <h2>Copland's Music</h2> <p>Twenty-one photographs capture performances or rehearsals of thirteen musical works. The orchestral works represented are the\u00a0<em>Piano Concerto</em>, in a photograph showing Copland at the piano and Andr\u00e9 Previn conducting; the\u00a0<em>Clarinet Concerto</em>with Benny Goodman as the soloist and Copland conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the\u00a0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>\u00a0in two rehearsal photographs, one in color with Marian Anderson as the speaker and the other with Adlai Stevenson, both with Copland conducting. The two ballets represented are scenes from the premiere performance of\u00a0<em>Appalachian Spring</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress and\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em>, which was premiered by Lincoln Kirstein and the Ballet Caravan.</p> <p>Three of the eight films for which Copland wrote music scores are illustrated in this online collection. Production stills represent\u00a0<em>The North Star</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>. There are also two informal photographs of the making of\u00a0<em>The Red Pon</em>y depicting Copland with the pony and the young boy and one studio-recording shot of Copland conducting the music for\u00a0<em>Something Wild</em>\u00a0that shows the star, Carroll Baker, in a television monitor.</p> <p>One chamber work is represented in a rehearsal of the\u00a0<em>Nonet</em>\u00a0at the Library of Congress with Copland conducting. Two photographs depict William Warfield with Copland during rehearsals of\u00a0<em>Old American Songs</em>. There is also a stage shot of the opera\u00a0<em>The Tender Land</em>.</p>  <h2>Copland with Other Composers and People</h2> <p>Numerous photographs capture Copland with fellow composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez, Norman Dello Joio, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Irving Fine, Arthur Berger, Douglas Moore, Benjamin Britten, Darius Milhaud, Philip Ramey, Walter Piston, Domingo Santa Cruz, Virgil Thomson, Roger Sessions, and Igor Stravinsky. He is also shown with such notable cultural figures and musicians as Artur Rubinstein, Claire Booth Luce, Clarence Adler, Nadia Boulanger, Victor Kraft, Vivian Perlis, Claire Reis, Jack Garfein, Thorton Wilder, Serge Koussevitzky, Agnes de Mille, and Oliver Smith.</p> <h2>Places and Events</h2> <p>The group of photographs entitled Places and Events shows Coplan Fontainebleau and Aldeburgh; in Paris, Germany, England, Peru, Israel, and Mexico; at Nadia Boulanger's studio with other students; at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and Tanglewood; and at the University of Kansas, Brown University and Columbia University.</p> <h2>The Copland Writings</h2>  <p>Aaron Copland was best known first as a composer and later, in the 1960s and '70s, as a conductor. His name is less frequently associated with literary endeavors. The\u00a0Writings\u00a0portion of the\u00a0Aaron Copland Collection\u00a0suggests that in this respect his reputation should perhaps be revised: it includes a vast array of articles, lectures, speeches, book drafts, and radio and television commentaries that span the years 1925 to 1988. The long stream of Copland's literary efforts began with an article written for publication in 1925, shortly after his return to the United States from three years in Paris, and continued into the late 1970s and early 1980s. He displayed the same technique in his writings that he did in his music: that is, a frequent self-borrowing in which he used the same material in different media.</p> <p>The writings selected for this online collection comprise eighty-six items. The selections represent unpublished drafts of material for articles, lectures, and speeches. Some selections display Copland's literary processes in thoughtful revisions, word changes, rearranging, and other editorial techniques. He usually began with handwritten notes or drafts and proceeded through several typewritten drafts before creating a final unmarked typewritten version. (Example: \"A Visit to Snape,\"\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0026?sp=1\">Version 2</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0027?sp=1\">Version 3</a>\u00a0) Not every literary work in the Aaron Copland Collection illustrates this transformation, however. The lectures and speeches display another aspect of Copland's literary endeavors: the fact that he underscored almost every word in red or blue pencil. Because he probably made these markings to help him deliver his speeches, they recapture something of the sound as well as the thought of his vocal presentations. They also add a colorful element to the handwritten and typed drafts.</p> <p>Like many conductors, Copland used a similar device in his conducting scores, where red and blue pencil markings draw the eye to changes in time signature, dynamics, and the entrances of instruments. [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0092?sp=1\">\"Talk on Leonard Bernstein\"</a>]</p> <p>Whatever their intended uses, the online examples of Copland's unpublished writings can be grouped into four categories: autobiographical, about Copland's music, about other composers, and about other people.</p> <p>The two autobiographical titles contrast the esoteric concerns of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0005?sp=1\">\"Music and the Human Spirit\"</a>, in which Copland addresses \"the creation of an art music\" as one of \"humanity's truly unique achievements,\" with the practicality of\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0003?sp=1\">\"The Composer as Conductor\"</a>\u00a0in which he recalls that \"Some twenty years ago, during the course of a memorable evening at the Stravinskys' home in Los Angeles, the venerable maestro turned to me and said in no uncertain terms: 'My dear, you should conduct your own music. All composers should conduct their own music!'\"</p> <p>The writings about Copland's music highlight eleven of Copland's compositions in five different media. Writings on two ballets describe his collaboration with Martha Graham (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0007?sp=1\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>) and his work with Lincoln Kirstein on the story for<em>Billy the Kid</em>, (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0008?sp=1\">\"About\u00a0<em>Billy the Kid</em></a>\" and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0018?sp=1\">\"Notes on a Cowboy Ballet\"</a>). Copland discusses the creation of his three major solo piano works,\u00a0<em>Piano Fantasy</em>\", \"<em>Piano Sonata</em>,\" and \"<em>Piano Variations</em>,\" in two different lectures under the title <a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0011?sp=1\">Compositional Phases [on My Three Piano Works]</a>.\" An article about the 1925 orchestral work\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0017?sp=1\"><em>Music for the Theatre</em></a>\u00a0summarizes the reaction of audiences, musicians, and reviewers in the United States and Europe, including the performance by the New York Symphony Orchestra in which its conductor, Dr. Walter Damrosch, had \"revenge in the end.\" Copland wrote\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0028?sp=1\">A Visit to Snape</a>\u00a0for a tribute to Benjamin Britten on his fiftieth birthday; in it, he extols the \"kind of composer rapport\" between them and the \"exchange of musical impressions\" between his own \"The Second Hurricane\" and Britten's Piano Concerto No. 1.</p> <p>As the composer of several film scores, Copland was frequently asked to lecture or write about composing for the movies. In his discussions on the subject, Copland speaks not only about his experiences and the scores he wrote, but about other film composers and working in Hollywood. In\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0012?sp=1\">\"Film Music\"</a>, a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art Film Library in 1940, Copland briefly describes Hollywood and the mysterious nature of film music. He talks about the music he wrote for the film\u00a0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0049\"><em>Of Mice and Men</em></a>; four film composers, Eric Korngold, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, and Herbert Stoddard; and some of their film scores. By the time he gave the lecture\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0015?sp=1\">\"Film Talk\"</a>\u00a0at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, Copland's credentials as a film composer included six feature films and two documentaries. On that occasion, excerpts from three features (<em>Something Wild</em>,\u00a0<em>The Red Pony</em>, and\u00a0<em>The Heiress</em>) and one documentary (<em>The City</em>) were screened as he commented on how music may help a film and how one sets music to a film.</p> <p>The largest category of writings in this online collection centers on Copland's views about other composers. In these works, Copland speaks not only about his American contemporaries but about Mozart\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0037?sp=1\">(\"At the Thought of Mozart\")</a>, Berlioz\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0039?sp=1\">(\"Berlioz - from the Composer's Standpoint\")</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0040?sp=1\">Pierre Boulez</a>;<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0049?sp=1\">Composers in Russia</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0051?sp=1\">Composers of South America</a>; Michael Tippett (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0055?sp=1\">\"Cousin Michael\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0057?sp=1\">Darius Milhaud</a>, Dmitri Shostakovitch (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0059?sp=1\">\"Dmitri Shostakovitch and the New Simplicity\"</a>),\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0060?sp=1\">Gabriel Faur\u00e9</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0062?sp=1\">Franz Liszt</a>, Gustav Mahler\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0077?sp=1\">(\"Mahler (XX Cent[ury]\")</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0091?sp=1\">Igor Stravinsky</a>, Serge Prokofieff [Sergey Prokofiev]\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0087?sp=1\">(\"On the Occasion of the 70th Birthday of Serge Prokofieff\")\u00a0</a>, Benjamin Britten\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0090?sp=1\">(\"Special Fondness for B.B. [Benjamin Britten]\")\u00a0</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0097?sp=1\">Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly</a>. Copland was concerned above all with educating others about composers and their music, and in these writings he sometimes presents his personal viewpoints and reflections. At the National Arts Club in 1968, for example, he spoke about Leonard Bernstein's gifts and how it was \"impossible to imagine the American musical scene in the last quarter century without him.\" [Example:\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0075?sp=1\">\"LB\"</a>]</p> <p>As Copland lived on through the century, he was asked to write celebratory epistles or obituaries about many of his contemporaries, whether they were composers or others who had influenced his life. These writings about other people offer Copland's portraits of his Parisian teacher, Nadia Boulanger\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0099?sp=1\">(\"Intro[duction] of N[adia] Boulanger as Teacher\")</a>; his early theory teacher, Rubin Goldmark<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0112?sp=1\">(\"Rubin Goldmark: A Tribute\")</a>; his publisher, Ralph Hawkes\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0111?sp=1\">(\"Ralph Hawkes: In Memoriam\")\u00a0</a>; his friend and colleague at the League of Composers,<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0109?sp=1\">Claire Reis</a>; and his long-time supporter, the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0114?sp=1\">(\"Serge Koussevitzky - The 100th Anniversary [unpublished writings]\")</a>. \"It is almost forty years since first I rang the bell at Nadia Boulanger's Paris apartment . . . \" begins the 1960 tribute to his teacher,\u00a0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0102?sp=1\">(\"The Teacher: Nadia Boulanger\")</a>, the person who was most influential in molding and forming the composer Aaron Copland.</p>"], "timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:55:18.087Z", "campaigns": [], "extract_timestamp": "2020-01-31T07:06:10.084Z", "date": "1841", "shelf_id": "~/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "other_title": ["Copland collection,"], "count": 982, "dates": ["1841-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "number_lccn": ["2003561015"], "language": ["english"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/", "hassegments": false, "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/aaron-copland/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/aaron-copland/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/copland/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2003561015", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2003561015/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/collmus.mu000006", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006.3/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu002006.3", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collmus.mu000006/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu002006/"]}, {"access_restricted": false, "original_format": ["collection", "book"], "id": "http://www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection/", "partof": ["african and middle eastern division", "digital collections", "abdul-hamid ii collection of books and serials gifted to the library of congress"], "subject": ["world cultures & history"], "index": 12, "group": ["collections-portal"], "title": "Abdul-Hamid II Collection of Books and Serials Gifted to the Library of Congress", "digitized": true, "description": ["<p>In 1884 Sultan Abdul-Hamid II gifted the Library of Congress with a collection of Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Arabic works that he had richly embossed with this inscription in English, French and Ottoman: \"Gift made by H.I. M. the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II to the national library of the United States of America through the Honorable A.S. Hewitt Member of the House of Representatives A.H. 1302-1884 A.D.\" </p>  <p>The Sultan's gift arrived in the U.S. Capitol, where the Library of Congress was housed, until the Jefferson Building was completed and they could be unpacked and shelved.</p>  <p>In the 1907 Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam stated: \"About 400 volumes, bound in red Morocco with gilt edges, have been given by the present Sultan, Ghasee Abdul-Hamid II. They comprise works of native authorship, also translations from European languages of works on Medicine, History, Law, Mathematics, Arts, Drama, Fiction, etc.\"</p>  <p>The remarkable story of how the Sultan met and befriended Abram Stevens Hewitt (1822-1903), Member from New York's 10th district, reported in the <em>New York Tribune </em>(July 13, 1884), began while Hewitt and his young son were touring around St. Sophia and palace grounds in Constantinople during a very hot day. When the young boy fainted, he was taken to the guard house where two other boys his age observed all the excitement and reported back to their father, the Sultan, what they had seen.\u00a0Their father dispatched his emissaries to Hewitt's hotel to inquire about his son's well-being and to request that he and his son visit the palace the next day.</p>  <p>During the visit, the Sultan noticed Hewitt's indelible pencil and special cigarettes which resulted in a gift shipment to Abdul-Hamid II when Hewitt returned home. Shortly thereafter, Hewitt received a notice that he owed $1,480 in customs duties on a shipment of Ottoman books. He wrote back to the Sultan that he didn't deserve such an honor and that the Sultan should give the books to the Library of Congress. The Sultan agreed and had the special collection prepared for the Library and invited Hewitt to keep the first set for himself. Hewitt paid the duty and this set is now in the New York University Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.</p>  <p>By 1984, it was determined that the Abdul-Hamid II gift books had become very brittle with paper that was too fragile to serve to researchers and a decision was made to microfilm the collection. 309 books and serials have been scanned from this microfilm for this digital collection.

The Lincoln Papers came to the Library of  Congress from Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln (1843-1926), who  arranged for their organization and care shortly after his father was  assassinated on April 14, 1865. At that time, Robert Todd Lincoln had the  Lincoln Papers removed to Illinois, where they were first organized under the  direction of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln's  longtime associate. Later, Lincoln&rsquo;s presidential secretaries, John G. Nicolay  and John Hay, assisted in the project. In 1874, most of the Lincoln Papers  returned to Washington, D.C., and Nicolay and Hay used them in the research and  writing of their ten-volume biography, <em>Abraham Lincoln: A History</em> (New  York, 1890). Robert Todd Lincoln deposited the Lincoln Papers with the Library  of Congress in 1919, and deeded them to the Library on January 23, 1923. The  deed stipulated that the Lincoln Papers remain sealed until twenty-one years  after Robert Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s death. On July 26, 1947, the Lincoln Papers were  officially opened to the public. </p>  <p>The most complete account  of the early history of the Abraham Lincoln Papers appears in volume 1 of David  C. Mearns, <em>The Lincoln Papers</em> (Garden City, N.Y., 1948), 3-136. An  article by the same author which appeared in the December 1947 issue of the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/alajournals/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Abraham Lincoln Quarterly</em> <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> contains the substance of the story.

The Lincoln Studies Center at Knox  College in Galesburg, Illinois performed the editorial work, which included  selecting the documents to be transcribed. &nbsp;Their choices were based on  either a document's historical importance or as representative of the  president&rsquo;s unsolicited incoming mail. Annotated transcriptions were provided  for all of the documents in Lincoln's own hand and for secretarial copies of  Lincoln documents located in Series 1-3 of the Lincoln Papers.&nbsp;Many of the  other transcriptions were also annotated to aid users in identifying the people  involved and in better understanding the content and historical contexts.&nbsp;Annotations for Lincoln's  autograph documents usually include a headnote providing historical and  documentary context, as well as annotations on the content of the document.  Annotations for incoming correspondence typically identify persons and  organizations writing to Lincoln or referred to in the documents, explain terms  and events, and provide brief historical context. Together, these fully  searchable transcriptions and annotations dramatically extend access to the  Abraham Lincoln Papers and enhance their teaching and research value.

The online version contains 4,695 items (equaling about 51,500 images), consists of correspondence, scientific notebooks, journals, blueprints, articles, and photographs documenting Bell's invention of the telephone and his involvement in the first telephone company, his family life, his interest in the education of the deaf, and his aeronautical and other scientific research. Dates span from 1862 to 1939, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1865 to 1920. Included among Bell's papers are pages from his experimental notebook from March 10, 1876, describing the first successful experiment with the telephone, during which he spoke through the instrument to his assistant the famous words, \"Mr. Watson--Come here--I want to see you.\" Bell's various roles in life as teacher, inventor, celebrity, and family man are covered extensively in his papers. Complementing the Bell Papers are digital images of photographs from the Gilbert H. Grosvenor Collection in the Library's Prints and Photographs Division.</p> <p>The Bell Family Papers is divided into several archival series, including Family Papers, General Correspondence, Subject File, <em>Beinn Bhreagh Recorder</em>, Laboratory Notebooks, Article File, and Speech File.

Their various subjects include Bell's childhood, aeronautics, deaf   education, and scientific experiments. </li>   <li><a href=\"/search/?q=&fa=partof%3Aalexander+graham+bell+family+papers%2C+1834-1974.%3A+miscellany&sb=date\"><strong>Miscellany</strong></a><br />     This last series is composed of miscellaneous writings and copies   of correspondence, mostly by Alexander Graham Bell. There is also some   poetry, written both by and for Bell. </li> </ul> <p>Several factors defined the selection of Bell Papers for digitization. The collection as a whole includes the personal papers of not only Alexander Graham Bell but also those of his father, mother, wife, father-in-law, and other family members. Because the Bell Papers are so numerous and inclusive, navigation through them can be difficult. Therefore, one of the main objectives of the selection process was to identify those materials which mainly focused on Alexander Graham Bell and his work, varied interests, and achievements. Another important goal was to choose those materials that best offered a well-rounded portrayal of Bell--not only as an inventor and scientist but also as a teacher, husband, and father. Items were also selected if they appeared historically useful or significant, such as correspondence pertaining to the development of the Bell Telephone Company or Mabel Hubbard Bell's written accounts of her experiences growing up deaf. </p> <p> The Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers were donated to the Library of Congress by his heirs in 1975. Prior to this donation, the papers were on deposit at the National Geographic Society, where they were organized and maintained. In order to make the collection easier to use, the Society prepared typed transcripts of a large portion of the handwritten letters. These valuable transcriptions were retained and have been reproduced here along with the original letters. Occasionally the original is missing and only the transcription is still available. One should keep in mind that these transcripts are now decades old and may occasionally be difficult to read due to faded, bleeding, or blurred text.</p> <p> The Bell Papers contain a considerable amount of correspondence, much of which reflects the writing practices of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As letter writing becomes less popular, some awareness of common, older practices may be helpful. Since the typical handwritten letter is essentially a single sheet of paper folded in half (and usually written on all four sides), the digital scan and display of each unfolded sheet usually show an image of pages four and one (or back and front), and another of pages three and two (or the inside two pages). <a href=\"/resource/magbell.03500220/seq-1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Today's readers also should be aware of such papers-saving tactics as writing-over, or text over text. In such cases, the writer would literally write over a completed page, making the added words somewhat readable by turning the page sideways and writing horizontally against what were now vertical written lines. <a href=\"/resource/magbell.02800127/?sp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Surprisingly, if the writer was careful and lengthened his or her hand while also trying to write only in the spaces between lines, such letters can be read with little difficulty. </p>  <div class=\"i_aligncenter i_caption\"      style=\"width: 444px;\"> <a href=\"/item/magbellbib000925\"><img

The collection, consisting of approximately 12,000 items dating from 1708 to 1917, documents Hamilton's impoverished Caribbean boyhood (scantily); events in the lives of his family and that of his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton; his experience as a Revolutionary War officer and aide-de-camp to General George Washington; his terms as a New York delegate to the Continental Congress (1782-1783) and the Constitutional Convention (1787); and his careers as a New York state legislator, United States treasury secretary (1789-1795), political writer, and lawyer in private practice. Most of the papers date from 1777 until Hamilton's death in 1804.

They were transferred from the State Department to the Library of Congress in 1904. Additional papers came to the Library of Congress later through gifts and purchases from the Hamilton family and other sources. \u00a0Papers accumulated through 1981 were scanned from the microfilm edition made that year, and items acquired since were digitized from the originals.</p>  <p>Between 1961 and 1987, Columbia University Press published a twenty-seven-volume edition of the <em>Papers of Alexander Hamilton</em>, edited by Harold C. Syrett. Between 1964 and 1981, Columbia University Law School published a five-volume-edition of Hamilton's legal papers, with Julius Goebel as editor. These two editions have been used as definitive sources in the verification of names and in the dating and identification of manuscripts in the Hamilton Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>  <p>Although this collection is the largest gathering of Alexander Hamilton papers at the Library of Congress, there are significant additional groups of Hamilton letters and other papers in other Library of Congress collections, notably in the <a href=\"/collections/george-washington-papers/about-this-collection/\">George Washington Papers</a>.

It ends with his last letters to his wife before his death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July 1804.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+speeches+and+writings+file%2C+1778-1804\">Speeches and Writings, 1778-1804</a> (Reels 21-23)</strong><br>    Drafts, copies, and notes of reports; political essays, speeches, New York legislative acts, and more composed by Hamilton from the American Revolution until his death. Of note is an outline of the speech he delivered at the Constitutional Convention on June 18, 1787; his notes on debates and speeches at New York's ratifying convention, June 1788; drafts of the four major economic reports he wrote as treasury secretary (on public credit, creation of a national bank, establishment of a mint, and development of manufacturing); drafts of the speeches he wrote for George Washington, including Washington's 1796 farewell address; notes he took at New York's constitutional convention of 1787; and drafts of some of his political essays. None of Hamilton's <em>Federalist</em> essays are included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+legal+file%2C+1708-1804\">Legal File, 1708-1804</a> (Reels 23-29)</strong><br>    Papers documenting Hamilton's career as a lawyer, which began in 1782. Most of these are ordered alphabetically by case. Some of the landmark cases included in his papers are Rutgers v. Waddington, People v. Croswell, Hylton v. United States, and cases forming the LeGuen v. Gouverneur and Kemble litigation.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+financial+papers%2C+1782-1804\">Financial Papers, 1782-1804</a> (Reel 29)</strong><br>    The financial papers, which form the smallest segment of the collection, consist of two volumes of accounts relating to Hamilton's law practice, and a folder of miscellaneous receipts. Some of the receipts are for money Hamilton paid engineer William Pearce on behalf of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures to provide machinery for manufacturing cotton, 1791-1792.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+family+papers%2C+1737-1917\">Family Papers, 1737-1917</a></strong>  (Reels 29-31)</strong><br>    Letters and other documents of members of the Hamilton, Schuyler, and related families, but not including Alexander Hamilton himself. The series contains letters from Angelica Church (Hamilton's sister-in-law) and Philip Schuyler (Hamilton's father-in-law) to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton; from Philip Schuyler to his grandson, Philip Hamilton; and from Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton to her sister, Catherine Cochran, and to her son, Philip Hamilton. Through the marriage of Philip Hamilton to Rebecca McLane, several McLane family letters were incorporated into the papers. Most of the nonfamily correspondence of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton relates to the management of her properties and to arrangements for the publication of Hamilton's papers. Scattered letters addressed to Alexander Hamilton (Alexander and Elizabeth's grandson), James A. Hamilton, John Church Hamilton, and to members of the McLane family are also included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+miscellany%2C+1711-1820\">Miscellany, 1711-1820</a> (Reels 31-34)</strong><br>    A mixture of original and copied documents.

Originals include a letter from Nicholas Everton to Hamilton concerning  legal matters and a Treasury Department circular. Photocopied material includes  letters by Hamilton, miscellaneous images, and a page from a church register  recording his marriage.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+2017+addition%2C+1790-1804\">  2017 Addition, 1790-1804</a></a></strong> <br>       This series consists of fifty-five letters, originally owned by Hamilton  descendants, purchased by the Library of Congress at Sotheby's in January 2017.  Fifty-one of these, 1790-1804, are from Philip Schuyler (1733-1804) to his  son-in-law Alexander Hamilton and daughter Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. The  remainder consists of two additional family letters, a letter from Charles  Pierre L'Enfant to Hamilton, July 14, 1801, concerning L'Enfant's renovation of  City Hall in New York into Federal Hall, and a fragment of a will in Hamilton's  hand, [July 1795].     </li>   <li><strong>Oversize</strong><br>    Correspondence, reports, annotated drafts of the Constitution, writings, deeds, agreements, contracts, financial papers, certificates, and printed matter.
